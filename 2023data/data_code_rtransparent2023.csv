    see supplementary data 10 for details.;     we used data from the genotype-tissue expression project (gtex) v8 to identify whether the variants associated with low grip strength affect expression of genes (table 1; supplementary data 6).;     in magma analysis we found 80 go processes enriched in low grip strength-associated genes (see supplementary data 7 for details) mainly involved in the immune system and antigen presentation.;     using metaxcan17 we identified 24 genes with expression in skeletal muscle significantly enriched in the low grip strength gwas after benjamini-hochberg adjustment for multiple testing (supplementary data 8).;     we examined 83 traits in mendelian randomization analysis to find evidence for shared causal pathways with weakness (low grip ewgsop) at older ages: primary results presented are betas from inverse variance-weighted regression using the \"twosamplemr\" r package19 (fig 3; supplementary data 11).;     we found significantly increased likelihood of weakness (multiple testingadjusted p values < 0 05) with genetically predicted rheumatoid arthritis (odds ratio = 1 03 benjamini-hochberg adjusted p value = 5 3 x 10-4) presence of type-2 diabetes (or = 1 05 bh p = 2 5 x 10-3) or asthma and allergic disease (or = 1 07 bh p = 9 4 x 10-3) (supplementary data 11).;     the analysis of females only also identified depression (or = 1 21 bh p = 2 75 x 10-2) and colorectal cancer (or = 1 06 bh p = 2 75 x 10-2) (supplementary data 12).;     full results of mendelian randomization available in supplementary data 11 12 and 13.;     in the males type-2 diabetes significantly increased odds of ewgsop low grip (or = 1 08 bh p = 3 0 x 10-3) whereas greater plateletcrit (the volume occupied by platelets in the blood as a percentage) (or = 0 91 p = 3 0 x 10-3) and other haematological parameters appear to be protective (supplementary data 13).;     see supplementary data 14 for detailed results.;     as is noted in supplementary data 2 this gene is also associated with height in the gwas catalogue.;     in comparison to a previous study that analysed grip strength as a continuous measure in the uk biobank cohort9 that included nature communications | (2021)12:654 | https://doi org/10 1038/s41467-021-20918-w | www nature com/naturecommunications nature communications | https://doi org/10 1038/s41467-021-20918-w all aged (40-70 years) we found that only three of the 64 identified variants were significantly (p < 5 x 10-8) associated with ewgsop low grip strength (supplementary data 2).",""

    we also determined a 3 5-a crystal structure of unliganded dimeric dh717 1 fab (figures1f 1h and s1g; data s4).;     the structure revealed two disulfide-linked fab dimers in the asymmetric unit with a disulfide bond linking two fabs via vh gene residues cysteine 74 (figure 1h) dh717 3 which only showed y-shaped abs had a serine at this position (figure s1f) and disrupting the disulfide in dh717 1 with a cysteine to serine (c74s) mutation resulted in loss of dh717 1 i-shape forms (figure 1i) and reduction in binding and neutralizing activity (figures1j 1k and s1h) dh717 1 fab monomer did not bind recombinant hiv-1 env trimers whereas the fab dimer bound with micromolar affinity and the dh717 1 igg mab bound with nanomolar affinity thus demonstrating a role for avidity in env glycan recognition of fdg abs (data s1).;

    whereas g5/g6 mpp3 cells retained their overall functional identities (supplementary fig 3d) g5/g6 mpp2 cells exhibited megakaryocyte bias (supplementary fig 3e) and g5/g6 mpp4 cells underwent dramatic transcriptional and functional reprogramming of their lineage fate towards the myelomonocytic output (fig 1e supplementary fig 3f and supplementary dataset 2).;     consistent with previous findings that hscs' transition from quiescence towards cell-cycle entry is a continuous rather than stepwise progression18 pseudotime analysis (supplementary fig 4a) identified five cell clusters of cells whose transcriptional programs transited from quiescence (cluster 0 marked by the high expression of meg3 mllt3 and cdkn1c and the downregulation of biosynthetic processes such as rna metabolism and respiratory electron transport) (supplementary fig 4b c) towards a proliferative state (clusters3 and 4 marked by the expression of cell cycle genes) (supplementary fig 4d and supplementary dataset 3).;     we identified three cell clusters with distinct tf binding motif enrichment in open chromatin regions (fig 2c and supplementary dataset 4).;     consistent with our transcriptomic results differential analysis of chromatin accessibility in the samples showed that g5/g6 hscs atop the hematopoietic hierarchy (cluster 0) had increased activities of irf family tfs (fig 2d and supplementary dataset 5).;     among the irf tfs accessible irf2 binding sites were enriched in the distal elements of genes mainly involved in platelet function and biogenesis including the tf gata2 (supplementary fig 4h and supplementary dataset 6) which is consistent with previous findings that irf2 regulates the megakaryocytic differentiation of hscs24.;     using an integrated approach to analyze g0 and g5/g6 hscs together we identified nine cell clusters defined by the transcriptional dynamics induced by pi:pc treatment (fig 3a b and supplementary dataset 7).;     right the distribution of hscs from g0 and g5/g6 mice among the five scrna-seq clusters represented as the percentages of cells belonging to each cluster b left pathway enrichment analysis of the marker genes of cluster 1 shown in fig 2a and supplementary dataset 3 (adjusted p <= 0 05).;     source data are provided as a source data file but not monocytes or platelets (supplementary fig 8a); significantly decreased numbers of hscs and mpp4 cells but increased numbers of mpp2 cells in the bm (supplementary fig 8b);

    consistent with previous findings3132 this gradient showed that cells at the apex 6 of the hematopoietic hierarchy were platelet-biased (cluster 5 which had the highest level of vwf expression) (supplementary fig 9g and supplementary dataset 9).;     veh vehicle c joint pathway enrichment analyses of the marker genes that define each of the clusters shown in fig 3b and supplementary dataset 7 (adjusted p <= 0 05).;     scrna-seq of hscs isolated from g0 and g5/g6 mice treated with control- or a151-odn (fig 4e and supplementary dataset 10) showed that genes involved in ifn signaling activation (including ifi203 irf2 and irf7) and hemostasis were significantly decreased in the more primitive hscs (cluster 2) isolated from a151-odn-treated g5/ g6 mice as compared with those of control-odn-treated mice (fig 4f and supplementary fig 10f).;     consistent with the patients' normal pb counts (supplementary table 2) we did not detect any aberrant distribution of telomeredysfunctional hspcs into the hematopoietic clusters as compared to those from age- and gender-matched healthy donors (hds) (fig 5a and supplementary dataset 11).;     cells atop the hematopoietic hierarchy (cluster 3) had the lowest activity of tfs involved in lineage specification (supplementary dataset 12) and the highest rate of open chromatin peaks in the promoters and distal elements of the hsc markers mllt3 and hlf (supplementary dataset 13).;     differential analysis of chromatin accessibility in the samples revealed that tert-mutant cells in this cluster showed an increased activity of tfs involved in ifn signaling regulation including irf2 irf7 irf3 and stat1 and open chromatin peaks in the distal elements of genes involved in hemostasis (fig 5d supplementary fig 12b and supplementary dataset 14 15).;     cells atop the hematopoietic hierarchy (cluster 0 with the highest expression of mllt3 and meg3) were severely depleted as compared to those from hds but the frequency of the megakaryocyte-biased hspcs was increased (fig 5e and supplementary dataset 16).   data availability data sets generated in this study using scrna-seq and scatac-seq have been deposited at the geo database under accession codes \"gse169709",""

    sorafenib a drug indicated for hepatocellular carcinoma was predicted to lower sbp because its ilincs perturbation data reversed the hypertension gene expression signature (supplementary data 7).;     in the vumc sd study however sorafenib increased sbp (5 12 mm hg p = 0 04; fig 3b and supplementary data 13) a side effect that has been previously reported34.;     the first approach employed the widely used false discovery rate (fdr) metric with a cutoff of q < 0 0558 to compute the gene expression signatures for hyperlipidemia (supplementary data 3) and hypertension (supplementary data 5).;     from this sorted list of degs we computed the k = 50 hyperlipidemia gene expression signature by selecting the top fifty most up- and downregulated genes for a total of 100 genes (supplementary data 2).;     from this gene list we computed the k = 50 hypertension gene expression signature which was composed of 53 upregulated and 48 downregulated genes for a total of 101 genes (supplementary data 4).;     the lists were combined to create one ilincs drug repurposing candidate list for each disease (supplementary data 6-7).;     we suppressed values if there were less than twenty individuals in the subgroup due to individual privacy concerns (supplementary data 9).;     for age and elixhauser comorbidity index6364 reported statistics are median and interquartile range (iqr) in the baseline and treatment periods; p values are from wilcoxon signed-rank tests to identify statistically significant differences between baseline and treatment periods with p < 0 05 considered statistically significant (supplementary data 10).;     we removed elixhauser comorbidity statistics if there were less than twenty individuals in the subgroup due to individual privacy concerns (supplementary data 11).;     for each biomarker we report the mean and sd of the median measurements during both baseline and treatment periods (supplementary data 12) 10 to determine whether individuals exposed to a drug repurposing candidate experienced significant biomarker changes we used a linear mixed model6667.;     for each drug repurposing candidate we report the treatment effect as a point estimate (i e mean difference between median biomarker measurements from the baseline and treatment periods) with 95% ci and associated p-value from the linear mixed model (supplementary data 13).","for their drug repurposing studies researchers can adapt the software tools and computational notebooks that we have made publicly available (https://pwatrick github io/drugrepurposingtoolkit/)."

"35078996",TRUE,"general-purpose repository, supplement",FALSE,"snp correlations at protein-associated loci from the ages cohort are available from zenodo org (https://doi org/10 5281/zenodo 5711426).  we performed a gwas of 4782 serum proteins encoded by 4135 unique human genes in the population-based 2 ages cohort of elderly icelanders (n = 5368 supplementary data 1) measured by the slow-off rate modified aptamer (somamer) platform as previously described818.;     in a conditional analysis using gcta-cojo1920 and validated using individual-level data (supplementary fig 2) we identified 4035 study-wide significant associations between 2024 independent genetic signals in 772 loci (defined as genetic signals within 300 kb of each other) and 2091 unique proteins (fig 1a-c and supplementary data 2-4).;     for 336 (23 7%) of the 1415 cisassociations the lead variant was or was in ld (r2 > 0 8) with a pav affecting the corresponding gene thus potentially representing epitope effects (supplementary data 3).;     of the 35 trans hotspots14 also affected protein levels encoded by proximal genes thus acting in cis as well (supplementary data 3).;     to define what proportion of the pqtls identified in the present study can be considered novel we compared all studywide significant pqtls with previously reported pqtl studies (supplementary data 5) including the recent exome-array analysis of the ages cohort22.;     we find that proteins with study-wide significant genetic associations especially those acting in cis are generally more likely to have tissue-enriched gene and protein expression and are more often secreted compared to those with no detected genetic signals (fig 2a and supplementary data 6 and 7).;     by contrast proteins with trans only signals are enriched among transmembrane proteins (fig 2a and supplementary data 6 and 7).;     furthermore we find that proteins with cis signals and especially those tagging pavs (supplementary fig 9) generally have lower lof intolerance that is they are more tolerant to deleterious mutations and they tend to have lower hub status in both ppi and co-regulatory networks indicating a more peripheral position of cis regulated proteins in protein networks (fig 2b and supplementary data 6 and 7).;     we obtained gwas summary statistics for 81 diseases and clinical traits (supplementary data 8) and identified all genomewide significant (p < 5 x 10-8) gwas loci overlapping with a study-wide significant pqtl from our results.;     of those 218 gwas loci (associated with 69 phenotypes) had high support (pp4 > 0 8) for colocalization with 1045 proteins (fig 3 and supplementary data 9 and 10).;     additionally medium support (0 5 < pp4 < = 0 8) was found for colocalization between 171 proteins and 84 loci associated with 49 phenotypes (fig 3 supplementary data 9 and 10).;     in a secondary analysis (see methods) we found that 84% of the protein-phenotype pairs with high support (pp4 > 0 8) for colocalization remained so with a more stringent coloc prior selection (supplementary data 10 and supplementary fig 12).;     here we observed 178 instances of colocalization with medium or high support of which 51 (involving 19 loci 14 phenotypes and 40 proteins) were not captured in the initial colocalization analysis (supplementary data 11 and 12).;     for article 102 of 203 (50 2%) unique pairs of gwas lead variants and colocalized cis-pqtls the protein was different than that encoded by the nearest gene to the gwas lead variant (supplementary data 10).;     these pleiotropic loci included for example the abo locus best known for its role in determining the abo blood groups which was found to harbor eight independent protein signals within a 28 kb region (chr 9 136127268-136155127) (supplementary data 4) where pqtls for 63 proteins colocalized with 17 phenotypes predominantly cardiometabolic and hematopoietic (fig 4a and supplementary data 10).;     another example of a pleiotropic locus is a 46 kb window (chr 19 49206108-49252151) harboring variants adjacent to or within fut2 that are associated with diverse traits (fig 4b and supplementary data 10) including immune (crohn's disease and type 1 diabetes) anthropometric (waist-to-hip ratio and offspring birth weight) cardiometabolic (blood pressure ldl and total cholesterol) and renal (bun and uacr) fut2 encodes for fucosyltransferase-2 that synthesizes the h antigen in body fluids and the intestinal mucosa while a nearby gene fgf21 is an important metabolic regulator32 acting for example through its effects on sugar intake33.;     phenotype abbreviations are available from supplementary data 8 architecture of immune disorders has been well documented in the literature and is mirrored in multiple colocalized pqtls shared between various immune diseases (supplementary fig 18).;     taking advantage of the deep phenotyping of the ages cohort we examined direct associations between colocalized proteins and 37 phenotypes that were measured in the ages cohort (supplementary data 13).;     for a quarter (10/37) of the phenotypes tested we observed a significant enrichment of phenotype associations among the sets of colocalized proteins compared to 6 randomly sampled proteins (fig 5 supplementary fig 22 and supplementary data 14) demonstrating more generally that gwas loci for complex phenotypes regulate serum proteins that themselves are often directly associated to the phenotype itself.;     in some cases this enrichment was driven by proteins regulated from a few trans loci as evident by the loss of significance when the analysis was repeated without pleiotropic loci regulating five or more proteins leaving on average 17 proteins per trait (fig 5 and supplementary data 14).;     this was particularly evident for alzheimer's disease where the enrichment was entirely driven by the associations of proteins regulated by the apoe locus (supplementary data 13).;     in other cases the removal of proteins regulated by pleiotropic loci resulted in an enhanced enrichment of phenotype associations such as for hba1c mean platelet volume and diastolic blood pressure (supplementary fig 22 and supplementary data 14).;     phenotype abbreviations are available from supplementary data 8.;     by evaluating each individual locus separately we identified six loci with significant phenotype-association enrichment among its linked proteins that colocalized with gwas signals for the respective phenotype thus demonstrating specific examples of genetic variants whose molecular and phenotypic consequences are linked within the same cohort (supplementary data 15).;     cohort participants aged 66 through 96 were included from the ages-reykjavik study42 a prospective study of deeply phenotyped individuals of northern european ancestry (supplementary data 1).;     to evaluate the novelty of the genetic associations identified in the current study we compared our results to 20 previously published proteogenomic studies (supplementary data 5) including the protein gwas in the interval study9 our previously reported genetic analysis of 3219 ages cohort participants8 and a recent illumina exome-array analysis in 5343 ages participants22.;     we restricted the study selection to those with study sample sizes of n > 10 k of primarily european ancestry (to match the ages cohort's ld structure) having at least one genome-wide significant association (p < 5 x 10-8) and selecting one study per phenotype (supplementary data 8).;     for each gwas phenotype with a corresponding measurement in ages and well represented at the population level (supplementary data 8) the colocalized proteins were tested for association with the phenotype in all ages participants with protein data available (n = 5457 see n missing per phenotype in supplementary data 1) in a linear or logistic regression model adjusted for age and sex.;     the protein gwas summary statistics data from this study were deposited in the gwas catalog database with accession ids for each summary statistics dataset based on unique somamers as listed in supplementary data 16.",""

    applying a bonferroni corrected significance threshold of p < 1 92 x 10-10 (0 05/54469/4782) we detected 5451 exome array variants that were associated with variable levels of 1942 (2138 aptamers) serum proteins (supplementary data 1 and fig 2) of which 2021 exome variants were independent affecting 1942 (2135 aptamers) proteins (supplementary data 2).;

    next we cross-referenced all the 5451 study-wide significant pqtls with a comprehensive collection of genetic loci associated with diseases and clinical traits from the curated phenoscanner database26 revealing that 60% of all pqtls were linked to at least one disease-related trait (supplementary data 4).;     the circos plot highlights the effect of the variant rs2251219 (supplementary data 1 and 2) on 13 proteins acting in cis or trans and sharing genetics with various diseases of different etiologies.;     the variant was also associated with igfbpl1 (p = 3 x 10-18) in serum (supplementary data 1) a protein recently implicated in axonal growth28.;     the variant rs610932 was also associated with the proteins gltpd2 and a4galt (supplementary data 1).;     furthermore a two-sample mr analysis using genetic instruments across the trem2 and ms4a4a/ms4a6a loci and gwas associations for load in europeans as outcome32 provided evidence that variable trem2 protein levels are causally related to load (p = 5 3 x 10-5) (fig 4d and supplementary data 5).;     the instrument rs7232 (fig 4d) an independent variant associated with trem2 (supplementary data 2) is a missense variant in ms4a6a that has previously been linked to load (supplemental data 4) but the ms4a cluster has recently been shown to modulate the production of soluble trem233.;     variable levels of the cell adhesion protein svep1 are associated with variants located at chromosomes1 and 9 (supplementary data 1 fig 5a and supplementary fig 5).;     all significant pqtls are listed in supplementary data 1 and 2 and the overlap with gwas risk loci is summarized in supplementary data 4 associated with svep1 serum levels (supplementary data 2).;     given the currently available gwas summary statistics a two-sample mr analysis using cis-variants on chromosome 9 for svep1 as instruments and gwas associations for t2d35 support a causal relationship of svep1 with the disease (p = 5 7 x 10-6) (fig 5e supplementary data 5) but not with chd36 or systolic blood pressure37 (p > 0 05) (supplementary data 5).;     we found that the melanoma risk allele for rs910873 was associated with elevated asip serum levels (p = 5 x 10-179) (fig 6a table 1) while the variant had no effect on other proteins measured with the current proteomic platform (supplementary data 1).;     importantly we found that serum asip levels were supported as causally related to malignant melanoma (p = 1 1 x 10-17) using a twosample mr analysis on the protein-to-outcome causal sequence of events (fig 6b supplementary data 5).;     the broken line indicates the inverse variance weighted causal estimate ( = -0 240 se = 0 059 p = 5 3 x 10-5 two-sided) while the dotted line shows the mr-egger regression (see supplementary data 5 for more details).;     in brief using all conditionally independent study-wide significant 6 associations (supplementary data 2) and a linkage disequilibrium (ld) threshold of r2 < 0 5 for novel associations the current study's snp-protein associations are 76 8% novel compared to emilsson et al 10 75 5% novel compared to sun et al 11 and 59 3% novel compared to all published pqtl studies (supplementary fig 6a supplementary data 6 and supplementary note 1).;     the broken line indicates the inverse variance weighted causal estimate ( = 0 104 se = 0 023 p = 5 7 x 10-6 two-sided) while the dotted line demonstrates the mr-egger regression (see supplementary data 5).;     the broken line indicates the inverse variance weighted causal estimate ( = 0 0024 se = 0 0003 p = 1 1 x 10-17 two-sided) while the dotted line shows the mr-egger regression (see supplementary data 5) c the pqtl rs2241714 is a proxy for colorectal cancer-associated variant rs1800469 (r2 = 0 978) (supplementary data 2) located within the gene b9d2 and proximal to tmem91 which is the reported candidate gene at this locus (see table 1).;     finally when estimating novelty at the locus-protein level we find that 321 out of 881 loci and 762 out of 3103 locus-protein associations identified in the current study are novel compared to our companion paper50 (supplementary data 7 supplementary note 1).;     when the two companion studies were combined they yielded 404 new loci and 1950 new locus-protein associations which were not found in previous pqtl publications (supplementary data 6 supplementary data 7 and supplementary note 1) 8 we report here that many of the measured serum proteins under genetic control share genetics with a variety of clinical features including major diseases arising from various body tissues.;     these analyses found no evidence of horizontal pleiotropy (supplementary data 5) nor did they demonstrate that the causal estimates were dependent on a single genetic instrument (supplementary fig 7).;     we report both variants to protein associations at p < 1 x 10-6 for suggestive evidence and bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons by adjusting for the 54469 variants and 4782 human protein analytes where single variant associations with p < 1 92 x 10-10 were considered study-wide significant (supplementary data 1).;     we conditioned on the current lead variant listed in supplementary data 1 defined as the variant with the lowest p-value and then kept track of any new variants that were not in ld (the default gcta-cojo option r2 < 0 9 for co-linearity) with previously chosen lead variants and reported findings at p < 1 x 10-6 (supplementary data 2).;     supplementary data 3 summarizes through the use of vep (v104 0)2425 various pathogenicity prediction scores for all independent study-wide significant pqtls in supplementary data 2 including the likelihood ratio test62 variant effect scoring tool63 mutationassessor64 and mutationtaster65.;

second some t3-regulated genes from rna-seq analyses are likely regulated by t3 indirectly and thus do not have tres.;     go analysis revealed that not surprisingly development-related go terms were highly enriched among the genes bound by tr (supplementary data 5).;     in addition many apoptosis-related go terms were also found to be enriched among the tr-bound genes (supplementary data 5) in agreement with the fact that the first major change to take place during intestinal metamorphosis is the degeneration of larval epithelium via programmed cell death which takes place before massive proliferation of adult epithelial stem cells522.;     interesting we found that many cell cycle/proliferation-related go terms were highly enriched among the trbound genes (fig 2a and supplementary data 5).;     no downregulated genes were found by rna-seq in this pathway proliferation pathways were enriched along with signaling pathways known to be important for apoptosis and for stem cells such as sonic hedgehog notch and wnt/-catenin pathways23 (fig 2b and supplementary data 6).;     to investigate this possibility we carried out chip-seq analysis on the intestine from premetamorphic tr-/- tadpoles treated with or without t3 as above and identified 2892 and 2469 genes bound by tr in the 4 tr knockout intestine (as tr was the only tr expressed in tr knockout animals) in the absence or presence of t3 respectively (supplementary data 7-9).;     venn diagram analyses revealed that most of genes bound by tr in tr-/- animals were independent of t3 treatment i e common between tr-/- tadpoles treated with t3 and without t3 (fig 4a supplementary data 9 10) again indicative of constitutive binding by tr as observed for the wild-type animals.;     when we compared the chip-seq data between wild-type and tr-/- intestine we found that of the 4605 tr target genes in wild-type intestine nearly 70% or 3129 genes were bound by tr in tr-/- intestine while 94% of 3327 genes bound by tr in tr-/- intestine were bound by tr in wild type (fig 4c supplementary data 10) demonstrating high producibility of the our chip-seq assay and suggesting that both tr and tr can bind to the same target genes.;     by comparing the go terms and pathways enriched among tr-bound genes in the wild-type intestine (supplementary data 5 and 6 respectively) and tr-/- intestine (supplementary data 11 and 12 respectively) we obtained go terms (supplementary data 13) and pathways (supplementary data 14) that were enriched among tr-bound genes in wild-type intestine but not enriched among tr-bound genes in the tr-/- intestine.;     in addition there were also many tr-dependent go terms (supplementary data 13) and pathways (supplementary data 14) related to stem cells which may explain the lack of adult intestinal epithelial cell proliferation within the first 3 days of t3induced metamorphosis in tr-/- tadpoles19.;     importantly as with all enriched go terms or pathways in the wild-type intestine we found many cell cycle/proliferation-related communications biology | (2022)5:112 | https://doi org/10 1038/s42003-022-03061-0 | www nature com/commsbio communications biology | https://doi org/10 1038/s42003-022-03061-0 article go terms (supplementary data 13) or pathways (fig 6a and supplementary data 14) that were enriched in the wild-type intestine but not tr knockout intestine.;     furthermore rna-seq analysis showed that most of the tr-bound genes in this pathway were upregulated after 18 h t3-treatment (fig 6b and supplementary data 15)19.;     our chip-seq analyses showed that interestingly most of the genes detected by chip-seq with a polyclonal tr-antibody recognizing both tr and tr were common in the wild-type and tr-/- intestine with or without t3 treatment (figs1 and 4 supplementary data 10).;     the pathways that were enriched among genes bound by tr in the wild-type intestine (supplementary data 6) were subtracted by the pathways that were enriched among genes bound by tr in tr-/- intestine (supplementary data 12) to obtain the pathways only enriched in the wildtype intestine (supplementary data 14).;     the most significant 10 cell cyclerelated pathways were plotted here (see supplementary data 20 for raw data) b tr-binding and regulation of genes in the pathway for cell cycle based on chip-seq and rna-seq data.;

"35697682",TRUE,"supplement",FALSE,"descriptive statistics on the appearance of amd in the 5457 person ages-rs cohort ages67 years and older (mean age 76 6 +/- 5 6 years; 57 3% female) are shown in supplementary data 1.;     using sex and age-adjusted logistic regression analysis of 4782 proteins (4137 gene symbols) and two distinct definitions of early-stage amd (see methods section for details) 2 we discovered that 28 serum proteins were associated with different stages of amd using a study-wide significance threshold (fig 1a-c table 1 supplementary fig 1a-c and supplementary data 2 and 3).;     this included 15 proteins associated with earlystage amd identified using both holliday et al 22 and jonasson et al 23 classification criteria with two proteins unique to jonasson et al 23 and 10 proteins unique to holliday et al 22 (fig 1a supplementary fig 1a and supplementary data 2 and 3).;     we note that the aptamer specificity for 15 of the amd-associated proteins with sufficient pull-down mass spectrometry sensitivity was fully validated using orthogonal analysis (methods section and supplementary data 4).;     many of the 28 amd-associated proteins were correlated to each other (supplementary fig 5) and in fact 12 of these 28 proteins were enriched in a single module of the serum protein network (p = 2 1 x 10-8) (fig 2c and supplementary data 5).;     similarly some amd-related proteins were abundantly expressed in amd-relevant ocular cells (supplementary fig 6) whereas others were enriched in tissues such as the liver and brain (supplementary data 6).;     in the most recent gwas meta-analysis of advanced amd fritsche et al 10 examined 16144 amd patients identifying 52 independent common and rare variants across34 distinct genomic loci (supplementary data 7).;     here 18 of the risk loci for amd were associated with a total of 340 serum proteins (supplementary data 7 and 8).;     in addition the variant rs11080055 linked to the previously described11 hotspot rs704 (r2 = 0 784) was associated with several hundred serum proteins (supplementary data 7 and 9).;     the amd associated variant rs10922109 in the cfh gene at 1q31 3 for example was significantly associated with amd in the ages-rs (p = 2 6 x 10-16) (supplementary data 7) and influenced the levels of 40 serum proteins (fig 5 and supplementary data 7 and 8) including the amd-associated proteins cfhr1 tst dll3 st6galnac1 cfp and ndufs4 (fig 5 table 1 and supplementary data 8).;     among the proteins associated with rs10922109 complement system proteins are significantly over-represented (supplementary data 10).;     for more information see supplementary data 2 and 3 bthe term p adj refers to the p-value adjusted for the number of comparisons.;     finally out of the 40 proteins associated with rs10922109 11 proteins cluster in protein module pm13 (supplementary data 11 and 12).;     aside from the expected enrichment of the complement system among the 340 proteins associated with amd-linked variants (supplemental data 8 and 10) there were many previously unknown links including slc5a8 (aka smct1) slc5a8 is a na+-coupled transporter located in the retina and notable for its ability to transport the prodrug 2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylate (otc) across the retina2930.;     this protein was found to be linked to two amd-associated variants rs2070895 and rs2043085 in or proximal to the lipc gene (supplementary data 8 and fig 6e) as well as the apob intron variant rs2678379 (fig 6e) which is a well-established regulator of plasma lipoprotein (hdl ldl and triglycerides) levels31.;     the proteins linked to amd-related genetic variants map to pathways with both known and previous unknown association to the disease (supplementary note 1 and supplementary data 10).;     we examined the relationship between all known amd-related gwas variants and the 27 serum protein network modules through their eigenproteins (1st and 2nd principal components) 4 the modules in supercluster iii (modules pm11 to pm15)11 were associated with the largest number of amd-causing genetic variants (supplementary data 13).;     for example the cfh variant rs570618 at 1q31 3 which is a proxy for the cfh y402h (aka rs1061170) missense mutation was linked to amd risk (supplementary data 7) and is associated with 217 serum proteins100 of which are found in pm13 (supplementary data 8 and 11).;     also rs570618 was significantly associated with the eigenprotein for the amd-associated protein module pm13 (supplementary data 13) further reinforcing its connection to amd.;     in passing rs570618 was associated with 33 of the 40 proteins linked to rs10922109 (see above) and are both intronic snps in the cfh gene in a moderate linkage disequilibrium (r2 = 0 41) but the latter is also associated with 184 other serum proteins (supplementary data 8).;     the protective allele a for rs6677604 was significantly associated with reduced risk of late amd in the ages-rs cohort ( = -0 04 p = 3 0 x 10-7) and was also strongly linked with lower serum levels of cfhr1 ( = -1 33 p = 2 7 x 10-890; supplementary data 14).;     definition of early-stage amd in a b d was according to holliday et al 22 and the number of patients in each amd-related group is shown in supplementary data 1.;     ns denotes not significant (p > 0 05) rs6677604 was linked to 22 proteins in serum (supplementary data 14) including six proteins that were not associated with any of the other amd genetic markers listed in supplementary data 8 and 9.;     for instance calnexin (canx) was previously implicated in arms2 secretion35 and was one of the six novel proteins associated with rs6677604 (supplementary data 14).;     because the loci containing the genes encoding cfhr1 cfhr5 and fut5 are saturated with multiple independent variants for both amd (supplementary data 7) and proteins1314 colocalization analysis becomes difficult and thus inconclusive3839.;     here the allograft inflammatory factor 1 (aif1) was found to be significantly associated with amd outcomes in this population and directionally consistent with the causal estimate after multiple testing correction (supplementary data 15).;

    the circos plot depicts the relationship between the amd-associated variant rs10922109 at 1q31 3 and 40 serum proteins (see supplementary data 7 and 8 for details).;     the blue (trans effects) and red (cis effects) colored proteins are among the 28 amdassociated proteins listed in table 1 rs570618 amd risk allele t to elevated cfhr1 and cfhr5 levels33 which is consistent with our findings (supplementary data 8).;

    analyzing bulk rna-seq data with a deconvolution pipeline we predicted cell type compositions of 539 clear cell renal carcinomas investigated in the tcga project as well as those of 16 bhd-associated kidney cancers analyzed in this study (figures s2a-s2d and dataset s2) (cancer genome atlas research 2013; newman et al 2019).;     notably we found that a cluster of l1cam expressing cells expresses marker genes for principal cells of collecting duct whereas a cluster of foxi1 expressing cells and bhd-associated chromophobe renal cell carcinoma express marker genes for intercalated cells of collecting duct suggesting that these distinctly clustered hoct cells may develop in part by a mechanism similar to that of benign collecting duct cells (figures4b and s3a-s3d and dataset s3).;     in fact expression levels of intercalated cell marker genes in bhd-associated kidney cancers exceeded their expression level in normal kidney thereby supporting that the acquisition of intercalated cell characteristics in bhdassociated kidney cancer may be because of upregulation of foxi1 and its driven genes (figures4h and s3a-s3d and dataset s3).;

    for example one of the two associated regions on chromosome 17 mapt-crhr1 exhibited extended linkage disequilibrium with many snps spread broadly across several genes within the ~1 4 mb region flanking the index gene 4 (supplementary fig 3; supplementary data 5 6).;     these data were further supported by the large number of strong cis-eqtls and blood cell count traits reported for many of the snps in the sj\"ogren-associated mapt-crhr1 locus (supplementary data 7).;     logistic regression and bayesian analyses were used to refine the association signals from each of the 10 novel gws regions then posterior probability analyses were used to identify the 95% credible set of likely functional snps present in each region (fig 2b-k; supplementary figs3-12; supplementary data 5-34).;     bars indicate the 95% confidence intervals of the or from each quantile range n area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (auroc) values of prs using ld-pruned genotyped sj\"ogren-snps including snps from 6p21 3-22 3 in all genotyped sj\"ogren's cases (dark blue) or ro+ sj\"ogren's cases (green) relative to population controls and ld-pruned genotyped sj\"ogren-snps excluding snps from 6p21 3-22 3 in all genotyped sj\"ogren's cases (red) or ro+ sj\"ogren's cases (light blue) relative to population controls influence gene expression by one of four mechanisms: (1) intronic enhancers acting in cis and trans with a broader local regulatory network (cd247 xkr6 and syngr1) (supplementary figs4-6; supplementary data 8-16); (2) promoter and/or enhancer elements that act both in cis and trans within a broader local regulatory network (nab1 and rptor-chmp6-baiap6) (supplementary figs7 8; supplementary data 17-22); (3) intergenic enhancers interacting in cis (prdm1-atg5 and pttg1-mir146a) (supplementary figs9 10; supplementary data 23-28); and (4) intergenic enhancers acting in cis and trans (tnfaip3 and tyk2) (supplementary figs11 12; supplementary data 29-34).;     four variants at the first intron of cd247 molecule gene (cd247; encodes the t cell receptor -chain) showed regulatory potential: rs7523907 (index snp) rs2949661 rs1214595 and rs1723018 (fig 5; supplementary fig 4; supplementary data 8-10).;     while rs7523907 and rs1723018 showed some coalescence between eqtls epigenetic marks and tad formation rs2949661 and rs1214595 are eqtls with corresponding tad interactions with the promoter of cd247 in cd4+ and cd8+ t cells (fig 5b; supplementary fig 4g-j; supplementary data 10).;     while tad information is currently unavailable for salivary glands eqtl data from salivary glands suggest that rs2949661 might modulate the expression of tor signaling pathway regulator (tiprl) and rs1723018 may influence pogo transposable element derived with krab domain (pogk) (fig 5b; supplementary fig 4h j; supplementary data 10).;     complete analysis of all 127 cell types and tissues from the roadmap epigenome consortium project are reported in supplemental fig 8 and supplemental data 3 b enrichment of heritability in cell type-specific enhancers reported in the enhanceratlas2 0 database.;     the association region peaking at rs4841466 positioned in the intron of xk-related 6 (xkr6) is an independent association signal from the previously reported fam167a-blk region (fig 2d; supplementary fig 5; supplementary data 11 12)4546; as observed in sle4748.;     bioinformatic analyses revealed that the index variant rs4841466 likely has no biological function (supplementary data 13); however four additional potential functional variants positioned in a predicted intronic regulatory element of xkr6 were identified in the 95% credible set: rs11250099 rs4841465 rs11250098 and rs4314618 (supplementary fig 5g-j; supplementary data 11 12).;     coalescence between epigenetic marks eqtls and tads indicated that rs11250098 and rs11250099 are most likely to impact enhancer activity that may target xkr6 and myotubularin-related protein 9 (mtmr9) (fig 5b; supplementary fig 5g i; supplementary data 13).;     the index snp rs2069235 positioned in the intronic region of synaptogyrin 1 (syngr1) has epimarks indicative of a promoter element for an alternate isoform in immune cells (fig 5b supplementary fig 6g; supplementary data 16).;     while the conditional analysis indicated a single effect in the region several snps were present in the 95% credible set and exhibited bioinformatic indicators of function including rs2069235 rs909685 rs2267407 and rs3747177 (fig 2h; supplementary fig 6; supplementary data 14-16).;     the impact annotation showed transcription factor binding activity for rs2069235 and rs3747177 (fig 5c) rs2069235 not only modulated syngr1 expression in several immune cell types and minor salivary gland but also showed coalescence of both tads and eqtls for activating transcription factor 4 (atf4) and chromobox 7 (cbx7) in macrophages and neutrophils (fig 5b; supplementary fig 6g; supplementary data 16).;     bottom panel shows the total number of active transcription factor binding sites detected at each indicated snp posterior probabilities that were located ~84 5 kb upstream of the peak association signal in the proximal promoter of pdgfb: rs5757585 rs11703434 rs137594 (fig 5b; supplementary fig 6k-m; supplementary data 14-16).;     on chromosome 2 an association peaking at rs2293765 positioned in the promoter region of nab1 was found to be independent of the previously established sj\"ogren's risk locus stat1stat4 ~350 kb downstream of the ngfi-a binding protein 1 (nab1) gene (fig 2b; supplementary data 17 18)49.;     epigenetic regulatory marks eqtls and tad data suggest that rs2293765 may alter promoter activity and nab1 expression as well as alter enhancer activity to modify major facilitator superfamily domain containing 6 (mfsd6) nuclear envelope integral membrane protein 2 (tmem194b/nemp2) and ac093388 3 expression in multiple cell types (fig 5b; supplementary fig 7g; supplementary data 19) tmem194b/nemp2 was also a cis-eqtl in the minor salivary gland for three correlated variants: rs11900804 (r2 = 0 96) rs2192008 (r2 = 0 94) and rs744600 (r2 = 0 72) (supplementary fig 7h-j; supplementary data 20).;     the index snp rs8071514 positioned in the promoter region of rptor-chmp6-baiap6 had the highest posterior probability of the 95% credible snp set but bioinformatic analyses suggested nature communications | (2022)13:4287 | https://doi org/10 1038/s41467-022-30773-y | www nature com/naturecommunications9 article nature communications | https://doi org/10 1038/s41467-022-30773-y that it was not likely functional (supplementary fig 8b; supplementary data 20-22).;     four additional snps in the 95% credible set exhibited bioinformatic indicators of function including epigenetic marks of both promoter and enhancer activity eqtls and tads in several immune cell types: rs4969328 rs6565516 and rs4969331 in the promoter region of charged multivesicular body protein 6 (chmp6) and rs6565518 in a predicted intronic enhancer of chmp6 (fig 5b; supplementary fig 8g-j; supplementary data 22).;     all three snps were also minor salivary gland eqtls for tmem105 long non-coding rna (tmem105) and small integral membrane protein 11 (smim11 a k a fam165b) ~314 kb and ~816 kb downstream respectively (fig 5b; supplementary fig 8g-j; supplementary data 22).;     in the region of prdm1-atg5 gws sj\"ogren-snp association was observed after meta-analysis peaking at rs526531 positioned 10 kb downstream of pr/set domain 1 (prdm1; encodes b lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1 (blimp1)) (fig 2j; supplementary data 23 24).;     seven variants in the 95% credible set clustered in an intergenic region enriched with enhancer regulatory marks (supplementary fig 9; supplementary data 25).;     of these four of the snps were eqtls for prdm1 and autophagy-related 5 (atg5) in immune cell types (fig 5b; supplementary fig 9; supplementary data 25).;     interestingly atg5 was also an eqtl in the minor salivary gland for rs526531 and rs533733 (fig 5b; supplementary fig 9g i; supplementary data 25).;     the tnfaip3 region of association peaked at rs61117627 (fig 2k; supplementary data 29 30) near the 3' end of tnf alpha-induced protein 3 (tnfaip3) gene.;     bioinformatic analyses revealed that rs61117627 is not likely functional but identified several other correlated variants within the 95% credible set that are likely functional (supplementary data 31).;     two variants rs10499197 and rs58915141 are positioned in a likely enhancer upstream of tnfaip3 that engages in several tads including the tnfaip3 promoter and are eqtls for tnfaip3 in multiple immune cell types (fig 5b; supplementary fig 11h i; supplementary data 31).;     in addition rs10499197 and rs58915141 have elevated transcription factor binding activity (fig 5c) rs5029924 had the highest transcription factor binding activity among the 95% credible snps (fig 5c) but no coalescence of eqtls and tads was observed for this snp (supplementary fig 11j; supplementary data 31).;     we did discover that rs7749323 the tagging snp of the previously 10 characterized tt > a variant contributing to hypomorphic tnfaip3 expression with the sle risk haplotype465051 is also an eqtl for ifngr1 in the minor salivary gland (fig 5b; supplementary fig 11g; supplementary data 31).;     in chromosome 19 the sj\"ogren-snp association peaked at rs11085725 an intronic variant of tyrosine kinase 2 (tyk2) (fig 2g; supplementary data 32 33).;     although rs11085725 and rs35251378 had the highest poster probabilities of those in the 95% credible set (supplementary fig 12b; supplementary data 32 33) bioinformatic analyses identified three other snps including the previously characterized missense variant in tyk2 rs2304256 as more likely to be functional (fig 5b; supplementary fig 12g-i; supplementary data 34)52-54.;     further icam5 which functions in innate immune responses5556 and eif3g which regulates the initiation of protein translation5758 were eqtls in the minor salivary gland (fig 5b; supplementary fig 12g-i; supplementary data 34).;     our bioinformatic analyses revealed that rs11250099 is positioned in an intronic enhancer of xkr6 that forms a tad with the promoter of mtmr9 and is an eqtl for mtmr9 in cd4+ and cd8+ t cells and b cells (fig 5b; supplementary fig 5g; supplementary data 13) mtmr9 encodes myotubulin-related protein 9 a protein that interacts and modulates the enzymatic activity of the autophagic inhibitor mtmr8 in hela cells and drosophila6869.;     the tag snp for the tt > a enhancer rs7749323 was a gws sj\"ogren-snp in this gwas and is an eqtl for tnfaip3 in neutrophils (figs2k 5b; supplementary data 31).;     interestingly rs7749323 is also a salivary gland eqtl for ifngr1 and engages the promoter of ifngr1 through chromatin looping in ebv b cells (fig 5b; supplementary data 31).;     like our ifngr1 finding we observed that rs533733 in the prdm1-atg5 locus is a salivary gland eqtl for the autophagy regulator atg5 and is positioned in a tad with the atg5 promoter in ebv b cells (fig 5b; supplementary data 25) leading us to hypothesize that the risk allele of rs533733 may also contribute to sj\"ogren's pathogenesis by modulating autophagy in the salivary gland.;     we obtained genotype data from a total of 3885 sj\"ogren's cases and 23725 population controls of european ancestry collected from the united states of america australia austria france germany hungary italy norway spain sweden switzerland and united kingdom (supplementary data 2).;     study_id=phs000672 v1 p1])19 ds5 (scandinavian-2) and ds6 (precisesads)82 (fig 1a; supplementary data 2).;     in addition we performed meta-analysis using case-control immunochip 1 0 data in ds716 (supplementary data 2).;     after quality control 3232 cases and 17481 population controls in the merged genotyped dataset and 619 cases and 6171 controls in ds7 were available for subsequent analyses (fig 1a; supplementary data 2).","last regulatory element locus intersection (reli) analysis [https://github com/weirauchlab/reli] was used to identify positional overlap between sj\"ogren's risk loci and transcription factor binding sites as well as the potential role for epstein-barr virus (ebv) in sj\"ogren's as had been reported in other related diseases3637."

    ingenuity pathway analysis (ipa) identified enrichments of degs in annotated pathways pertinent to oxytocin signaling including the \"oxytocin signaling pathway\" and \"g-protein coupled receptor signaling\" (dataset s1).;     muscle contraction-associated pathways that were annotated under \"nitric oxide signaling in the cardiovascular system\" \"relaxin signaling\" and the \"dilated cardiomyopathy signaling pathway\" among others also had overrepresentations of degs (dataset s1).;     further examining the degs that are associated with oxytocin signaling and muscle contraction revealed reduced mrna abundance of plcb4 which encodes the oxytocin receptor downstream effector plc in the mutant uterus (figure 2c and d dataset s1).;     in addition the mutant uterus also had a decreased expression of cacna1c cacna1d and cacna1e (figure 2c and d dataset s1) genes that encode voltage-gated calcium channels which have a role in regulation of myometrial contractions (21).;     moreover examining muscle-associated pathways including \"g-protein coupled receptor signaling\" \"relaxin signaling\" \"cellular effects of sildenafil (viagra)\" \"nitric oxide signaling in the cardiovascular system\" \"cardiac hypertrophy signaling\" and \"cardiac -adrenergic signaling\" identified the commonly annotated phosphodiesterase 5 (pde5) encoding gene pde5a (dataset s1) which had significantly lower mrna abundance in the mutant than the control uterus (figure 2c and d dataset s1).;     rna-seq data revealed that myometrial pgr loss resulted in 1535 degs between control and mutant uteri at the conceptus sites (dataset s2).;     gene ontology analyses revealed overrepresentations of muscle extracellular matrix and cell-matrix interaction genes in these degs in which most of these genes had relatively lower levels in the mutant (figure 3b and c and dataset s2) qrt-pcr assays on a panel of smooth muscle markers validated the rna-seq findings where the mutant myometrial defects were reflected by lower levels of rna abundance of tagln acta2 actg2 myh11 and cnn1 as compared with control (figure s2).;     based on the deg profile molecular activities of progesterone predicted by ipa were decreased in the mutant uteri as expected (dataset s2).;     in addition estimated activities of muscle and matrix regulators including tgf srf/myocd and ccn2 (ctgf connective tissue growth factor) were also lower in mutant than control uteri (dataset s2).;     the significant reduction of rna abundances and projected activities of muscle regulator myocd and matrix modulator ccn2 (dataset s2 and figure s2) indicate that both their levels and activities were affected by myometrial pgr and suggest their pivotal role in the impact of myometrial pgr loss on the mutant myometrial phenotype.;     color scale to the right denotes relative expression levels with increase in yellow and reduction in blue (c) selected biological processes and pathways from dataset s2 that are overpresented in the 1535 pgr downstream genes (d) comparison between pgr downstream genes and degs that are derived from term versus mid-pregnancy mouse myometrium [national center for biotechnology information (ncbi) accession number: gse25017].;     chip-seq assays and chromatin conformation capture by hic identified 47535 h3k27ac-positive enhancers13574 pgr occupying sites and 17807 topological dna contacts in 13 5 dpc uteri of wild type animals (table 1 and dataset s3).;     as expected dna binding motifs of pgr and myometrial regulators ap-1 and stat5 factors were overrepresented in uterine enhancers among others (dataset s4).;     overrepresentation of dna-binding motifs of known myometrial regulators including ap-1 stat and nfkb proteins can be found in either pgr occupying sites or in the pgr-binding enhancers (dataset s4).;     there are 4232 enhancers in direct contact with the tss of 2636 active genes via looping (table 1 dataset s5).;     based 47535 3264 13574 10843 (22 8%) 2427 (74 4%) 17807 4232 38117 648 14669 205 3203 on this criteria 38117 enhancers are found to be topologically associated with 8407 active genes (table 1 dataset s5).;     among the tss-contacting enhancers648 of them have direct contacts with 301 pgr downstream targets and 205 enhancers have pgr occupancy (table 1 dataset s6).;     on the other hand there are 14669 enhancers in the same loops of 1192 pgr downstream genes (table 1 figure 4b dataset s6).;     the 3203 enhancers of this cohort that have pgr occupancy are designated as the group a enhancers (table 1 figure 4b dataset s6).;     group a and group b enhancers manifest enrichments of common and distinctive transcription factor binding motifs (figure 4e and dataset s4).;     orders of motifs are arrangement based on hierarchical clustering of the enrichment p values myometrial regulators (figure 4e and dataset s4).;     additionally motifs of major muscle regulators mef2d and chop are also enriched in both enhancer groups (figure 4e and dataset s4).;     on the other hand motifs of muscle growth (srf nfat and klf) and inflammatory response (irf and fox) factors are statistically enriched only in group b enhancers (figure 4e and dataset s4).;     notably predicted molecular activities of ap-1 proteins srf and mef2d are reduced in mutant uteri (dataset s2) suggesting that pgr likely works with these factors in regulation of pgr downstream genes.;     pgr activities in human myometrial tissues the in-vivo pregnant mouse myometrial pgr gene signature (dataset s2) enables an estimation of pgr activities in human myometrial tissues.;     across the 39 human myometrial specimens published by mittal and colleagues (the mittal dataset) (29) inferred pgr activities in t-scores show correlations with the relative mrna levels of genes for muscle extracellular matrix and extracellular matrix-cell interactions (figure 5c and dataset s7) in the same direction as seen in the functional analysis conducted in the mouse model (figure 3b and dataset s2).;     notably inferred pgr activities are positively correlated with relative mrna levels of the muscle gene regulator myocd the extracellular matrix gene modulator ccn2 (ctgf) and contractility repressors plcl1 and zeb1 in the human myometrium (figure 5c and dataset s7) (6 13).;     moreover inferred pgr activities are inversely associated with relative mrna levels of gadd45a and rxfp1 (figure 5c and dataset s7).;     myometrial pgr modulates major pathways such as srf/myocardin and ctgf (dataset s2)which control expression of genes that encode building blocks for muscle and extracellular matrix respectively.;     myometrial pgr could also affect activities of a key contractile regulator zeb1 in our mouse model based on the expression patterns of zeb1 downstream genes (dataset s2) (24).;     in model systems both myocd and des rna levels decrease in oviducts of pgr-null mice (35) while myometrial pgr is required to sustain expression of these two genes in pregnant uteri (figure 3b figure s2 and dataset s2).;     myometrial pgr also regulates multiple component and regulator genes for extracellular matrix in either a direct or indirect manner (figure 3b dataset s2 and dataset s6).;     for example myometrial pgr promotes uterine col3a1 expression at the conceptus sites likely through direct transcription regulation (figure 3b figure s4 dataset s2 and dataset s6).;     cebpb and sp1 rna are expressed in human myometrial and pregnant mouse uterine tissues (dataset s2) (11).;     srf and its coregulators are expressed in human myometrial tissues (11) and the mouse uterus (dataset s2).;     the t-score calculation uses the gene expression matrix of the specimens normalized within individual datasets and the mouse pgr gene signature list that is converted to a format of up (positively regulated by pgr) and down (negatively regulated by pgr) based on the 1535 degs in dataset s2.   data availability rna-seq chip-seq and hic data were deposited in the ncbi gene expression omnibus (geo) under the accession number gse199104",""

    in gene module analysis (supplementary figs18e-19 and supplementary data 2) we found that wm-opc were enriched with go processes related to component organization molecule modification and stress granules (knn m6; supplementary fig 19d) whereas gm-opc enriched pathways are involved in neuronal support (pg m2; supplementary fig 19c) similar to those enriched in gm-microglia.;     as expected gene module and go analysis showed that astrocytes are generally involved in sterol biosynthesis (supplementary fig 39a and supplementary data 2) as they are the major cholesterol producers in the brain.;     we consistently found more and more unique ligand-target pairs in \"wm\" than in \"gm\" and these were generated by a wider variety of sender types (fig 8b c supplementary fig 41 and supplementary data 3).;     based on manually curated information in the ingenuity pathway analysis (ipa) database (supplementary data 4) we sorted genes into lists ordered them based on the phenotypic similarity between disorders and displayed the number of candidate genes in each list that were unique or shared across disorders; lists with <10 candidate genes were dropped for simplicity (fig 9a).;     most libraries were sequenced on illumina novaseq s2 but some used illumina miseq hiseq 2500 or hiseq 4000 according to the manufacturer's protocol; see supplementary fig 2 and supplementary data 1 for details.;     the option to estimate cell number automatically was used for most of the samples unless otherwise specified (see supplementary data 1 for details).;     see supplementary data 2 for the full list.;     since the probability is low for any ligand to be assigned to a particular cell type with this strategy it is sufficient to map intercellular interaction qualitatively and categorically (see supplementary data 4 for full report).;

    a total of 10 of 14 (71 4%-case 1) 23 of 42 (54 8%-case 2) and 13 of 19 (68 4% -case 3) of penncnv calls were supported by a cnv called in the wgs data (supplementary data 3).;     all duplications that were not supported by wgs were supported by the cnv map while approximately half the deletions were not (supplementary data 4).;     to prioritise genes for in silico and functional analyses we selected candidate gene loci with p < 0 01 from retrospective likelihood analysis effectively restricting hazard ratios to >1 25 and <0 75 (supplementary data 5-8).;     deletions overlapping brca1 increased breast cancer risk (hazard ratio (hr) = 1 29 95%ci = 1 13-1 49 p = 1 98 x 10-4) (supplementary data 5) for brca1 pathogenic variant carriers.;     assessing the hrs for cnv versus non-cnv pathogenic variants separately for brca1 and brca2 suggested elevated breast cancer risk for brca1 deletions (hr = 1 21 95%ci = 1 09-1 35) but not brca2 deletions (table 1 supplementary data 9).;     these results remained similar after excluding missense variant carriers from the analysis (supplementary data 9).;     a comparison of the isogenic control (mcf7-c1) and pathogenic variant carrying cells (mcf7-brca1+/-) with the parent mcf7 cells (mcf7-wt) showed no significant difference in cell proliferation (fig 2b supplementary data 10).;     there were also no differences in the relative expression of brca1 mrna between the isogenic mcf7-c1 and mcf7-brca1+/- lines and the parent mcf7-wt line (fig 2c supplementary data 10).;     however the mcf7-brca1+/- cells showed a significant 25% (p = 4 44 x 10-4) reduction in esr1 expression (fig 2d supplementary data 10) and a significant 78% (p = 2 03 x 10-3) increase in cyp1a1 expression (fig 2e supplementary data 10) consistent with breast cells with a pathogenic brca1 variant20.;     there was no significant difference in sult1a1 mrna expression between the mcf7-wt and the isogenic mcf7-c1 and mcf7-brca1+/- cells (fig 2f supplementary data 10) sirna was used to transiently reduce the relative expression of sult1a1 mrna in the isogenic mcf7-c1 and mcf7-brca1+/- communications biology | (2022)5:1061 | https://doi org/10 1038/s42003-022-03978-6 | www nature com/commsbio 3 article communications biology | https://doi org/10 1038/s42003-022-03978-6 fig 1 characterisation of sult1a1 a genomic viewer (ucsc) of the sult1a1 gene locus with copy number variants;

    as deletions overlapping sult1a1 were suggested to decrease breast cancer risk in brca1 pathogenic variant carriers the relative expression of brca1 was quantified to assess if the sult1a1 knockdown affected its regulation (fig 3b supplementary data 11).;     knockdown of sult1a1 expression did not alter the proliferation of the mcf7-c1 compared with the transfection control (fig 3c supplementary data 11).;     however when sult1a1 expression was reduced in mcf7-brca1+/- cells there was a 14% (p = 1 17 x 10-2) decrease in proliferation compared with the transfection control after 72 h of growth (fig 3d supplementary data 11).;     analysis using comet assays showed that treatment with 4-ohe2 (f(1 8) = 5 79 p = 4 28 x 10-2; fig 3e supplementary data 11) and mmc (f(1 8) = 5 73 p = 4 36 x 10-2; fig 3f supplementary data 11) increased comet tail moment length in mcf7-brca1+/- cells.;     there also was evidence that transfection with sisult1a1 reduced the average comet tail moment length for both 4-ohe2 (f(1 8) = 9 76 p = 1 41 x 10-2; fig 3e supplementary data 11) and mmc (f(1 8) = 5 69 p = 4 43 x 10-2;

for details regarding pathological findings in this cohort of animals see supplementary fig 2) (fig 2a).;     next we employed rna-seq analyses to determine the age in life when transcriptomic changes relative to the young adult baseline are first discernable in our cohort of animals (fig 2g-j; supplementary fig 3; supplementary data 3-5).;     while in spleen many changes relative to the young adult baseline began to be detectable at 14 months (fig 2i j; supplementary data 3) significant differences relative to the 3-month baseline in brain were largely restricted to the two oldest groups (20 and 26 months; fig 2h; supplementary fig 3; supplementary data 4).;     based on the set of molecular markers tested age-associated alterations were noted in 14 out of 55 in the brain 17 out of 55 in the lung and 20 out of 57 in the spleen (fig 2l; supplementary data 6).;     among all age-sensitive markers most showed relative stability between 3 and 5 months and clear changes compared to the young adult baseline (3 months) were detectable primarily in the oldest groups (20 and 26 months) (fig 2m; supplementary data 6).;     an exception to this notion were age-related changes in cell proliferation markers that decremented early (between 3 and 5 months) and remained stable afterwards (fig 2m n; supplementary data 6).;     we chose the young group to be 3 months of age when the analyses commenced and ~5 months at their completion implying that the measurements were carried out during a period of relative stability of most asps (fig 2; supplementary data 1 2).;     pathway analyses of brain data are shown in supplementary fig 3 k-n summary of molecular analyses designed to study putative driver mechanisms of aging in spleen lung and brain k schematic illustration of study design (for sample size see supplementary data 6) l proportion of age-sensitive molecular parameters obtained m proportion of the different age-at-first-detectable-change categories among all age-sensitive molecular markers in individual tissues n representative examples of molecular markers covering the different hallmarks of aging.;     this design choice was made to minimize confounding effects of differential survival in our analysis of mutant mice vs controls by the ghrhrlit/lit genotype while 38 were opposed by the ghrhrlit/lit genotype (fig 3c; supplementary data 7 8; 5 asps could not be evaluated because cohen's d effect sizes could not be computed due to 0 values in the denominator).;     first we analyzed a mouse line with a loss-of-function mutation in ghrhr (coding for the growth hormone releasing hormone receptor)59 (fig 3; supplementary figs5 6; supplementary data 7 8).;     further analyses of asps based on the results of posthoc tests are described in supplementary results supplementary fig 7 and supplementary data 8.;     in most cases however effect sizes in young and old mice were not significantly different (fig 3g; supplementary data 7 8).;     sample sizes (number of mice per group) underlying these analyses are detailed for each phenotype and all paais in supplementary data 8 10 and 13 independent cis-eqtl i e a polymorphism significantly associated with ghrhr expression levels (supplementary fig 8)76.;     these asps potentially correspond to phenotypes in which aging trajectories were slowed by the ghrhr mutation genotype the clear majority (56) was countered by the mtorki/ki genotype (fig 6c; supplementary data 9 10; 15 asps were accentuated by the mtorki/ki genotype; 4 asps could not be evaluated because cohen's d effect sizes could not be computed due to 0 values in the denominator).;     in most cases however effect sizes in young and old mice were not significantly different (fig 6g; supplementary data 9 10).;     we applied the same analytical approach to a hypomorphic mtor mutant mouse line featuring mtor expression levels reduced to 25% of those seen in wt littermate controls57 (fig 6; supplementary figs5 6; supplementary data 9 10).;     further analyses of asps based on the results of posthoc tests are described in supplementary results supplementary fig 7 and supplementary data 10.;     these analyses identified 54 genes that were agesensitive (fdr < 0 05) and 855 genes that were genotype-sensitive with an intersection between these populations of 9 genes (supplementary fig 9a; supplementary data 11).;     source data are provided as a source data file 30 with a significant diet x age interaction (fig 8c; supplementary fig 5; supplementary data 12 13).;     further analyses of asps based on the results of posthoc tests are described in supplementary results supplementary fig 7 and supplementary data 13.;     statistical comparison of genotype effect sizes in young mice vs effect sizes in old mice showed that in 31 out of 42 cases effect sizes in young and old mice were not significantly different (fig 8g; supplementary data 12 13).;     we identified 11 phenotypes with significantly larger effect sizes in old mice than in young mice (fig 8g; supplementary data 12 13) for example average respiratory exchange rate or nkt cell count.;     to address this we performed hierarchical clustering on the phenotypic data from the young control groups for each of our three intervention studies (supplementary figs10-12; supplementary data 14-16).;     analyses of intervention influences on clusters (based on different cluster definitions) are summarized in supplementary data 14-16.;     repeating the analyses outlined above on the tumor-free (i e free of macropathologically detectable tumors) set of mice revealed qualitatively similar results compared to the entire set of animals (supplementary figs13-16; supplementary data 2 8 10 13) suggesting that key observations of our study also hold up when considering only aged animals that are free of detectable neoplastic disease.;     animals for the quantification of asp trajectories were assessed at 3 5 8 14 20 and 26 months of age: we had one cohort of mice for all deep phenotyping as well as rna-seq analyses (data shown in supplementary data 1-5) and a separate cohort from which we harvested tissues for the molecular analyses presented in supplementary data 6.;

    the intermittent fasting (if) cohort has been previously described and was generated using an everyother-day feeding paradigm in group-housed male wild-type c57bl/6j mice10 (current analysis summarized in supplementary data 12 13 16).;     the number of animals examined depended on the specific experiment and assay used and is indicated in the data provided (for details see supplementary data 2 6 8 10 13).;     detailed information regarding the definition of relevant cell subpopulations and gating strategies applied is provided in supplementary data 2 as well as supplementary figs18 19.;

    as expected genes constituting embryonic positive pathways are enriched in several gene ontology (go) terms related to the processes which are crucial for embryonic development such as emt extracellular matrix (ecm) remodeling cellular proliferation and angiogenesis providing additional validation of our approach used to detect embryonic pathways (fig 1c supplementary data 2).;     we thus identified on average ~2000 ep as well as en exon skip events in each tissue (supplementary data 3); as expected ep and en exons exhibit opposite inclusion patterns in the pre- and postnatal stages (fig 1e and supplementary fig 1b).;     the host genes of ep and en exons are significantly enriched in tissue specific processes in the case of brain and liver (supplementary fig 1e supplementary data 4).;     to support this conclusion that removal of trd can affect the function of ost by affecting its localization we highlight the example of an integrin gene itga2b which contains an en exon encoding trd (supplementary data 7) in developing liver.;     source data for these figures are provided as a source data file on the expression levels of 442 annotated sfs (\"methods\" supplementary data 5).;     next we obtained the list of splicing factors that were significant positive predictors of median ep splicing during embryonic development based on their regression coefficients in the plsr model (\"methods\") and termed those as critical splicing factors (csfs supplementary data 5).;     further the deletion of orthologous genes of brain csfs results in defective nervous system development in mice and csfs from all three tissues are much more likely to result in preweaning lethality as compared to the other splicing factors (supplementary fig 4d supplementary data 6) further supporting the developmental role of csfs.;     many of the ep/en events are previously reported and experimentally validated to be alternatively spliced in various diseases including cancer (supplementary data 8) for instance apaf1 gene encodes an apoptotic protein and hosts an en exon encoding wd40 domain in developing brain.;     further many of the tetraspanins which are scaffolding proteins present at the membrane of the cell and mediate various cellular functions such as proliferation adhesion and signaling84 contained an ep or en exon encoding trds across the tissues (supplementary data 7).;     these examples (and supplementary data 8) support that the ep and en events can indeed change the function of proteins and contribute to the broad functional convergence observed between embryogenesis and cancer.;     the data includes multiple pre-natal and postnatal time points in each organ (supplementary data 1).;     step 1: we scored the activity of each of the 332 kegg pathways30 at each time point during development using the median of logtransformed expression of its constituent genes resulting in a 332 x n activity matrix where n is the number of developmental time points that were sampled for each tissue and are given in supplementary data 1.","all the scripts used for downloading and processing the rna-seq datasets are available in at https://github com/hannenhalli-lab/ altspldevcancer.;

    similar to qrt-pcr data bbd18/ bbd18 was expressed at induced levels in flacp::ibbd18(rec) cells cultured in the absence of iptg confirming the expression of bbd18/ bbd18 in these recovery cells as a result of a suppressor mutation (supplementary data 1: up-regulated down-regulated and tmt-ms).;     significantly the transcriptome of induced flacp::ibbd18 cells closely resembled that of wt cells with only 25 genes exhibiting increased expression while one gene bbd18 and one small rna sr0160 had decreased expression (supplementary data 1: up-regulated and downregulated & supplemental fig s1) 21 of the 25 up-regulated genes belong to the previously defined rpos-regulon2425.;

    these include ospc bba66 bbj24 and bba34 which are carried on plasmids that encode many previously identified rpos-regulated genes (supplementary data 1 supplemental fig s5)2425.;     interestingly de-induced flacp::ibbd18 cells exhibited increased expression of bbd20-22 which are telomeric to bbd18 on lp17 (supplementary data 1: up-regulated).;     we also noted that 130 up-regulated genes in de-induced flacp::ibbd18 relative to wt are encoded on the cp32 prophage plasmids many of which have been identified as rpos-regulated (supplementary data 1: upregulated)24257071.;     therefore we assessed the expression of srnas and found 118 small rnas (srnas) that were significantly upregulated in de-induced flacp::ibbd18 cells (supplementary data 1: upregulated).;     further investigation by qrt-pcr analysis revealed low levels of itta expression in wt and flacp::ibbd18 spirochetes (supplementary data 1 and supplemental fig s7)72.;     nature communications | (2023)14:198 deletion of rpos rescues the lethal phenotype of flacp::ibbd18 over-expression of bbd18 inhibits rpos-regulated gene expression60-6274 while de-induction of ibbd18 results in a significant increase in rpos transcript and rpos protein (fig 3 & supplementary data 1).;     additionally lethal engineered over-expression of rpos causes4 article https://doi org/10 1038/s41467-023-35897-3 relative to induced flacp::ibbd18rpos (supplementary data 1: rpos up-regulated and supplemental fig s1b).;     rna-seq analyses confirmed that bbd18 transcript was absent in flacp::/ibbd18rpos cells cultured without iptg (supplementary data 1: rpos down-regulated and fig 4f) demonstrating that growth of de-induced flacp::/ibbd18rpos resulted from deletion of rpos and not from a suppressor mutation that restored ibbd18 expression without induction.;     although deinduction of flacp::ibbd18 led to increased expression of around 300 genes (supplementary data 1: up-regulated and supplemental fig s1a) there were no genes with increased expression in de-induced nature communications | (2023)14:198 in addition to establishing the global transcriptome that follows rpos induction we analyzed the rna-seq datasets from the rpos strains to identify potential transcriptional regulatory intermediates between bbd18 and rpos.;     of these 15 genes (all plasmid-encoded) and one srna decreased in expression when bbd18 was removed in rpos spirochetes (de-induced relative to induced flacp::ibbd18rpos cells) (supplementary data 1: rpos down-regulated and supplemental fig s1b).;     this srna (sr0852) was not previously identified as differentially expressed during rpos induction nor was it down-regulated in de-induced flacp::ibbd18 in the current study (supplementary data 1: rpos down-regulated) rendering it an unlikely candidate for a key rpos-regulatory role.;     many (11/15) of the bbd18-dependent genes in the rpos background were previously identified as down-regulated in rpos-induced cells and a subset of these (9/11) were also identified as down-regulated in flacp::ibbd18 de-induced cells in the current study (supplementary data 1: down-regulated and rpos down-regulated supplemental fig s1)2425.;     the remaining genes influenced by bbd18 in the rpos background bbd20 and bbd22 in addition to the one up-regulated gene bbd23 (supplementary data 1: rpos up-regulated) are telomeric to bbd18 on lp17.;     however decreased expression of bbd20 and bbd22 in de-induced /rpos cells contrasts sharply with their pattern of expression in the presence of rpos where de-induction of flacp::ibbd18 results in a significant increase in bbd20 and bbd22 transcripts; this pattern suggests modulation of bbd20 and bbd22 expression by both bbd18 and rpos rather than a potential regulatory role between them (supplementary data 1: down-regulated and rpos down-regulated).;     intriguingly the only gene whose expression increased in flacp::/ibbd18rpos (with or without induction) relative to rpos spirochetes was bbd23 possibly reflecting the reduced level of bbd18 in the induced strain relative to wt (supplementary data 1: rpos up-regulated).;     however unlike bbd20 and bbd22 expression of bbd23 did not increase relative to wt with de-induction of flacp::ibbd18 (supplementary data 1: upregulated) again incompatible with a direct rpos-modulatory role.;     finally expression of yet another gene on lp17 bbd21 increased following de-induction of flacp::ibbd18 but this did not occur in the /rpos strains suggesting that bbd21 expression is rpos-dependent (supplementary data 1: upregulated rpos up-regulated and rpos down-regulated).;     depletion of bbd18 leads to prophage induction nature communications | (2023)14:198 the observed rpos-dependent increase in cp32 prophage gene expression242542-44 (supplementary data 1: up-regulated) led us to hypothesize that prophages were induced when rpos was overexpressed in the absence of bbd18.;     rna-seq analysis also identified a significant increase in expression of the majority of cp32 prophage genes in the absence of bbd18 (supplementary data 1: up-regulated).;     most of the cp32encoded proteins that could be detected with tmt-ms analysis were more abundant in de-induced flacp::ibbd18 (supplementary data 1: tmt-ms).;     indeed induction of lp28-2 phage is suggested by increased plasmid copy number data and increased lp28-2 gene expression in de-induced flacp::ibbd18 cells (fig 5b and supplementary data 1: up-regulated) and the increased amount of lp28-2 dna in the supernatant of de-induced flacp::ibbd18 cells lacking all seven cp32 plasmids (supplemental fig s8b).;     potential role of bbd21/para in prophage induction as described above expression of the lp17 gene bbd21 increased in deinduced flacp::ibbd18 spirochetes relative to induced or wt cells but was not differentially expressed in rpos cells consistent with rposdependent expression (supplementary data 1: up-regulated drpos upregulated and drpos down-regulated).;     contrary to our expectations flacp::ibbd18 spirochetes were able to persistently infect mice as confirmed by positive serological responses at three weeks post-feeding and recovery of spirochetes from tissues at five weeks after inoculation (all 7 mice inoculated with flacp::ibbd18 spirochetes became infected) (supplementary data 1: animal infections).;     when assessed at 1 week 7 weeks and ~16 weeks post repletion spirochetes were recovered from 100% (13/13) 70% (7/10) and ~82% (9/11) of larvae fed on wt-infected mice and from ~62% (8/13) 90% (9/10) and ~82% (9/11) of larvae fed on flacp::ibbd18-infected mice respectively (supplementary data 1: animal infection).;     similar to challenge by needle inoculation wt and flacp::ibbd18 spirochetes were infectious for mice by tick bite with the majority of mice seropositive at three weeks and spirochetes isolated from mouse tissues at 5 weeks post-infection (supplementary data 1: animal infections).;     pointedly flacp::ibbd18 spirochetes isolated from infected mice and nymphs maintained their dependence upon iptg-induction of ibbd18 for in vitro growth indicating that they were not escape mutants (supplementary data 1: animal infections supplemental fig s10).;     rna-seq and tmt mass-spec of flacp::ibbd18 cells revealed differential regulation of over 300 genes and 118 srnas when flacp::ibbd18 was de-induced (supplementary data 1: up-regulated and down-regulated supplemental fig s1).;     however the vast majority of these genes are rpos-regulated with 0 genes upregulated and only 15 plasmid genes and 1 srna down-regulated when ibbd18 was deinduced in cells lacking rpos (supplementary data 1: /rpos downregulated & supplemental fig s1).;     our interest focused on bbd21 when we noted elevated expression of bbd21 after iptg-induction of ibbd18 was removed suggesting a potential link between the para protein encoded by bbd21 and increased plasmid replication/prophage induction in spirochetes lacking bbd18 (supplementary data 1: up-regulated).;     larval ticks acquired flacp::ibbd18 spirochetes from infected mice retained them through the nymphal molt and transmitted flacp::ibbd18 spirochetes to na\"ive mice (supplementary data 1: animal infections).;     consistent with rpos-dependent induction of at least 2 different phage types (fig 6) de-repression of rpos also resulted in increased copy number gene expression and the presence of protected prophage lp28-2 dna which is unrelated to the cp32 prophage in the supernatant of flacp::ibbd18cp32 cells (figs5 6 supplementary data 1: upregulated and down-regulated and supplemental fig s8).;     rnasequencing of bbd18-depleted rpos over-expressing cells revealed over 300 differentially regulated genes and 118 srnas relative to wt or flacp::ibbd18 cells cultured in the presence of iptg (supplementary data 1: up-regulated and down-regulated supplemental fig s1).;

    newly generated sequencing data were combined with pacbio clr long reads and bionano optical maps already available for the same individual 16 the assembly was performed on the dnanexus cloud-based informatic platform for genomic data analyses (https://www dnanexus com/) using the vgp standard genome assembly pipeline 1 612 (https://github com/vgp/vgp-assembly; figure 1a). we also generated a draft mitochondrial genome for the species (figure s1; data s1).;     after manual curation (figure 1d; and see figure 1e and data s1) the primary assembly is1 11 gigabase pairs (gbp) long close to genomescope2 021 predictions (figure 1b; tables s1a and s1b; data s1).;     the assembly has a scaffold ng50 of 73 megabase pairs (mbp) a per-base consensus accuracy (qv) of 43 7 (~0 42 base errors/10 kilobase pairs [kbp]) and a k-mer completeness of 83 3% with a duplication content of 0 49% (figures1c and 1g; tables s1b and s1c; data s1).;     we assigned 98 2% of the assembled sequence to 39 autosomes and to the z and w sex chromosomes (figure 1g; table s2) which are usually challenging to assemble due to their highly repetitive nature 23 the assembly exceeds the vgp standard metrics (6 7 q40 c90) 12 the chromosome reconstruction (2n = 80) matches our cytogenetic analysis (figure 2a; data s1) in line with the current literature on pachytene karyotypes for the barn swallow 24 we defined chromosomes1-6 and z as macrochromosomes7-13 and w as intermediate chromosomes and 14-39 as microchromosomes (data s1).;     with respect to the 2019 long-readbased assembly16 (here after ''chelidonia'') the vgp assembly pipeline and our subsequent manual curation increased the assembly contiguity to the chromosome level (scaffold ng50: 26 vs73 mbp; figure 1g; table s1b; see data s1 for the expanded comparison).;     conversely accelerated site density was strongly negatively correlated with chromosome size (spearman's = -0 80 n = 38 p < 9 5 x 10-8) with microchromosomes richer in accelerated sites than other chromosome types (wilcoxon test w = 50 p = 4 6 x 10-5) as already observed in other birds38 gene ontology (go) analysis on the top 5% of genes with highest overlap with phylop accelerated sites (table s7) did not disclose any enriched go term (table s8; data s1).;     the top 20 conserved genes are largely involved in neural development and differentiation (table s9; data s1).;     among the top six we found genes involved in stress-related pathways (camk2n2 inhbb sumo2 nfia sox2 cnot; see data s1 for more details on gene functions and an additional analysis regarding camk2n2 potential involvement in the onset of synanthropic behaviors).;     marker catalog and genome-wide density to obtain a comprehensive catalog of snps (data s1) we generated high-coverage hifi data (ds1 ~20x coverage n = 5) for five h r rustica individuals (table s11a) and aligned them using bhirrus1 as reference.;     we also performed a coverage titration experiment (data s1) and found that snp distribution was still uniform across chromosomes even when hifi wgs was downsampled to 5x (96 33 snps/10 kbp; figure s6; table s13) supporting our hypothesis.;     as observed in other bird species4344 we detected a positive correlation between chromosome gc content and snp density in all datasets (data s1).;     overall our results indicate that the genetic association between loci in the barn swallow is extremely low and decreases rapidly within the first 10 kbp as expected in large panmictic populations49 indeed no evidence of population structure has been observed in the european subspecies (h r rustica) potentially due to extensive gene flow between breeding populations40 average r2 at increasing distance varied also across chromosome types confirming that avian microchromosomes are characterized by higher rates of meiotic recombination resulting in lower ld than macrochromosomes (figure 4b; table s15) 295051 additionally a chromosome scan for high-ld regions allowed by dense snp catalogs such as the one presented here led to the identification of genes putatively under selection (please refer to data s1 for a detailed analysis of the top candidate genes including bdnf and lgr4).;     one of the most compelling regions we identified harbors bdnf a very interesting candidate to be considered for future studies (figure s9; data s1).;     we identified a high homozygosity in the genomic region in some of the populations analyzed (data s1).;     however we confirmed the presence of a potential selection signature within this genomic region by computing the integrated haplotype homozygosity score (data s1).;     page 20 then generated using the maximum likelihood method a generalised time reversible (gtr) model and a gamma distribution (g) with 5 categories (see data s1).;     for each chromosome and dataset snps falling in intervals corresponding to genic intergenic exonic and intronic regions as determined from ncbi annotation were counted using bedtools v2 29 287 with the coverage -counts option (data s1).;     hhmi author manuscript relationship between ld and distance from chromosome ends: a potential correlation between ld and distance from chromosome ends was evaluated in ds2 1 2 2 3 1 1 3 1 2 combining chromosomes together according to their type (macrochromosomes intermediate and microchromosomes;

    hhmi author manuscript ihs computation: to calculate ihs namely the standardised log-ratio of the ihh (integrated haplotype homozygosity) values for the two alleles variants present on chr6 were phased with whatshap v0 18102 (https://github com/whatshap/whatshap) and the rehh103 r package was used (data s1).;     hhmi author manuscript titration of hifi reads: two downsampling experiments were conducted (data s1) the first one after individual variant calling and the second one after joint variant calling (n = 5).;

    nature communications | (2023)14:1069 e-mail: chris amos@bcm edu 1 article https://doi org/10 1038/s41467-023-36678-8 we took advantage of the genetic overlap between traits to identify additional independent genetic variants for psc alongside five immune-mediated disorders (supplementary data 2) highly correlated with psc: crohn's disease18 (cd) uc18 ibd18 lupus19 and primary biliary cirrhosis20 (pbc) using multitrait analysis of gwas21 (mtag).;     sample sizes used to derive the estimates of snpbased heritability and pairwise genetic correlation of psc in each trait are shown in supplementary data 1.;     our findings reported in supplementary data 3 demonstrated that the genetic architecture of psc susceptibility was positively correlated with that of several immune-related diseases including ibd (r_g = 0 46; p = 4 41 x 10-13) uc (r_g = 0 62; p = 5 18 x 10-15) cd (r_g = 0 24; p = 4 16 x 10-4) lupus (r_g = 0 21; p = 0 04) and pbc (r_g = 0 31; p = 3 95 x 10-4).;     mtag-identified genomic risk variants associated with psc susceptibility with a p < 5 0 x 10-8 are reported in supplementary data 4.;     to replicate the new mtag-identified psc-specific associations we downloaded gwas summary statistics from finngen14 and gwas catalog13 which are independent gwas from the discovery phase (supplementary data 2).;     we prioritized 406 unique genes from 20 psc susceptibility loci reported in supplementary data 5 that functionally mapped and annotated using mtag-identified gwas of which 109 genes were identified by position mapping of deleterious coding variants with the combined annotation-dependent depletion (cadd) score (posmapmaxcadd >= 12 37)50 (supplementary data 6).;     in the chromatin interaction mapping 278 genes (69%) are mapped to the regions interacting with the promoter of the listed gene and of which 90 genes (32%) were found in the liver tissue in which the chromatin interaction is observed (supplementary data 6).;     either chromatin interactions or eqtls within psc risk loci (supplementary data 5) were shown on chromosomes2 3 4 6 7 11 16 19 and 21 respectively (supplementary figs3).;     we found five immune-related genes including irf5 and smo (7q32 1) and has3 sntb2 and vps4a (16q22 1) within newly identified loci that have not been previously reported (supplementary data 7).;     out of 168 noncoding genes we observed 14 more likely deleterious genes (cadd phred >= 12 37) and 8 and 6 genes on promoter and permissive enhancer sites respectively (supplementary data 8 and 9).;     the full predictions for each snp can be found in supplementary data 10.;     based on the singlesnp pip with each locus we identified 32 variants falling into the 95% credible set across eight mtag-identified gwas loci (supplementary data 11).;     among seven mtag-identified new risk loci (2p16 1 4q24 6p21 2 6q23 3 7q32 1 10q24 2 16q22 1) colocalization nominated three candidate genes manba at 4q24 irf5 at 7q32 1 and nkx2-3 at 10q24 2 contributing to psc risk (supplementary data 12).;     notably a newly mtag-identified locus irf5 displayed the highest posterior probability scores indicating that both psc and each of the 30 tissues are associated and share a single functional variant (pp4 > 0 80) using coloc60 package (fig 4 supplementary fig 4 supplementary data 12).;     using string protein-protein interaction (ppi) networks61 these candidate genes are highly enriched for protein-protein interactions (p < 1 00 x 10-16) with enrichment at false discovery rate (fdr) < 0 05 of the following pathways: immune receptor activity beta-2-microglobulin binding (1 10 x 10-2) (fdr = 3 84 x 10-2) -13 cytokine-mediated signaling pathway (1 58 x 10 ) interferon-gammamediated signaling pathway (1 13 x 10-11) t-cell receptor signaling pathway(2 21 x 10-11) immune response-activating cell surface receptor signaling pathway (2 65 x 10-9) interleukin-7-mediated signaling pathway (9 21 x 10-9) tnfr2 noncanonical nf-kb pathway (7 90 x 10-3) th17 cell differentiation (2 63 x 10-6) and th1 and th2 cell differentiation (1 94 x 10-5) (supplementary data 13 supplementary fig 5).;

    although yim 93972 displays morphological features resembling those of actinomycetes it is otherwise a typical archaeon that in particular contains glycerol diether moieties (gdems) and phosphatidylglycerol phosphate methyl ester (pgp-me) in membrane lipids and an s-layer cell wall (fig 1c d supplementary fig 2 supplementary data 1).;     in two soil samples from aiding salt lake 47 sequences of 16s rrna gene were obtained and shown to form a clade together with yim 93972 (otu13 in supplementary fig 4a sequences in supplementary data 18).;     although all six genomes of the morphogenetic haloarchaeal strains consisted of two chromosomes of different sizes otherwise we identified many distinct genomic features (supplementary data 2 supplementary data 2b-f).;     phylogenomic analysis of 268 low-paralogy halocogs that are universally conserved in 130 genomes of class halobacteria (supplementary data 3) showed that yim 93972 and its morphogenetic relatives including h pleomorpha formed a clade with halomarina oriensis within the family halobacteriaceae (fig 2b supplementary_data_file_2).;     the morphogenetic haloarchaea shared a core of 2053 strictly conserved orthologous genes but lacked 336 genes that are common in other halobacteria (supplementary data 3 supplementary data 4a).;     we identified genes present in all 7 genomes of morphogenetic haloarchaea that are involved in trehalose biosynthesis and utilization28 dipicolinic acid biosynthesis29 and poly(r)-hydroxyalkanoic acid biosynthesis30 (supplementary data 3).;     analysis of the genome sequences of these 8 mutants identified two mutations in proteincoding gene sequences and one mutation upstream of a gene in all three bald mutants; and one mutation upstream of a gene in three of the five transitional mutants (supplementary fig 10c supplementary data 5).;     given the lack of an experimental genetic system for yim 93972 we performed whole transcriptomic (fig 3a supplementary data 6-9) and quantitative proteomic analyses (fig 4a supplementary fig 11 supplementary data 10-12) for two transitional and three bald mutants to further characterize the potential association of the identified mutations with the mutant phenotypes.;     j: translation ribosomal structure and biogenesis; k: transcription; l: replication recombination and repair; b: chromatin structure and dynamics; d: cell cycle control cell division chromosome partitioning; v: defense mechanisms; t: signal transduction mechanisms; m: cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis; n: cell motility; u: intracellular trafficking secretion and vesicular transport; o: posttranslational modification protein turnover chaperones;

p: inorganic ion transport and metabolism; q: secondary metabolites biosynthesis transport and catabolism; r: general function prediction only; s: function unknown transitional mutants (except for two biological replicates of mutant t2) and bald mutants but not the wild-type transcriptome (supplementary fig 10d supplementary data 7).;     furthermore orf_0238 was downregulated 3 9 fold (p < 0 001) at the protein level in the bald mutants (supplementary data 11-12).;     quantitative analysis revealed 107 genes (fig 3c-d supplementary data 9 supplementary data 19) and 118 proteins (fig 4d e supplementary data 12 supplementary data 20) that were significantly upregulated in the aerial hyphae of wild type compared to the substrate hyphae of both wild and mutant types.;     the differentially expressed genes and proteins play major roles in translation transcription metabolism and ion transport (figs3e and 4f supplementary data 13).;     in particular atp-binding cassette (abc) peptide transporter operon (orf_2669-orf_2673 on chromosome i) was significantly upregulated in wild-type aerial hyphae (fig 5a b supplementary data 14).;     in this operon the peptide-binding protein (orf_2669) was significantly upregulated 6 91 and 1 6 fold at the mrna and protein levels respectively (fig 5c supplementary data 21).;     the fold change and p-value were shown in supplementary data 4 for fig 5c d the morphological mutants are resistant to the toxic peptide bialaphos (n = 3).;     we introduced the entire orf_2669-orf_2673 operon of yim 93972 into the s coelicolor m145 bldka-ke/pib139 mutant (supplementary data 15 16) and found that aerial mycelium formation and sporulation were restored (fig 6b).;     in our transcriptomic and proteomic data 47 trs were found to be significantly up-or down-regulated in aerial hyphae comparted to substrate hyphae (supplementary data 17).;     besides the phylogenetic and morphological differences the isolate is differentiated from the closely related genera by its chemotaxonomic markers (supplementary data 1).;     functional annotation of halocogs was obtained by comparing halocog alignments to cdd55 and arcog56 sequence profiles using hhsearch53 268 halocogs with full complement of 130 genomes and at most 4 additional paralogs were used to determine the genome-level phylogeny of halobacteria (supplementary data 3 supplementary_data_file_2).;     gains or losses of a gene on a particular edge of a phylogenetic tree were inferred from changes in the posterior probability of this gene presence between the ancestral and the descendant genomes at the respective ends of this edge; a change in probability exceeding 0 5 in magnitude was interpreted as a likely gain or loss of the gene (supplementary data 4 and 4c).;     the detailed quality control was showed in supplementary data 6 and fig 3b.;     genes with ratios greater than 1 5-fold and p-value smaller than 0 05 (student's t-test) were considered as regulated and used for further bioinformatics analysis (fig 3d and supplementary data 9).;     protein changes greater than 1 5-fold and p-value smaller than 0 05 (significance a70) were considered as regulated which were further used for bioinformatics analysis (fig 4e and supplementary data 12).;

    these proteins with shared perturbation in pregnant and non-pregnant women with covid-19 can be grouped into four main clusters enriched for distinct biological processes (fig 4b and supplementary data 2).;     clusters1 and 2 were predominantly increased in covid-19 cases regardless of sex or pregnancy status while clusters3 and 4 were primarily decreased (fig 4b and supplementary data 2).;     first we identified all proteins that were differentially abundant with covid-19 which resulted in 708 differentially abundant proteins for pregnant women (fig 5a and supplementary data 3).;     labor status and maternal deterioration did not confound the covid-19-related differences observed in the proteome as demonstrated by sensitivity analysis (supplementary data 3).;     similarly we identified 2605 significant proteins with covid-19 for non-pregnant individuals (fig 5b and supplementary data 1).;     from these two lists we could identify the abovementioned 486 proteins that were significantly affected by covid-19 in both pregnant and non-pregnant groups and had a similar direction of change (supplementary data 1).;     as expected enriched biological processes in pregnant women with covid-19 were fewer than those in non-pregnant patients given the dampened protein response (fig 5c and supplementary data 4-6).;     consistent with such an observation pregnant covid-19 patients showed enrichment of processes related to extracellular matrix defense response and immune response (fig 5d) whereas those enriched in nonpregnant individuals included protein localization and transport peptide biosynthesis and translation (fig 5e and supplementary data 4 5).;     we summarized the biological processes perturbed with covid-19 in pregnant and non-pregnant patients according to disease severity (supplementary data 6).;     in addition to biological processes we also evaluated the enrichment of pathways and gene sets derived from the c2 collection of the msigdb database which includes canonical pathways and experimental gene sets such as those associated 6 with disease and viral infection (fig 5g and supplementary data 7-9).;     similar to biological processes pathways enriched in pregnant women with covid-19 included terms related to extracellular matrix; yet pathways associated with viral infection or anti-viral defenses were also observed (fig 5h and supplementary data 7).;     enriched pathways in non-pregnant covid-19 patients included terms related to platelet activation vegf and pdgf (fig 5i) while shared pathways included virus- and cancer-related terms (fig 5j and supplementary data 8).;     the shared c2 pathways perturbed with covid-19 between pregnant and non-pregnant patients were also summarized while considering disease severity (supplementary data 9).;     this analysis identified a core set of 33 proteins with opposing direction of change (fig 6a) and included proteins related to angiogenesis and wound healing as well as alarmins cytokines and growth factors (supplementary data 10).;     proteins that decreased with covid-19 in pregnancy but were increased in non-pregnant cases included vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (vegf-sr1 or sflt-1) and angiotensinogen (agt); yet this could potentially be explained by their already elevated baseline among pregnant patients (fig 6b c and supplementary data 10).;     consistent with these findings proteins that underwent pregnancy-specific regulation with covid-19 were enriched for biological processes and pathways related to vasodilation angiogenesis and regulation of inflammatory response (supplementary data 11).;

    the summaries for all the 39 tumor types are presented in supplementary figure s1c and s1 data.;     exposure of yeast cells to a mildly toxic (median survival ~75%) dose of potassium bromate caused an increase in the frequency of both canr and canr red mutants in ssdna (figure 1a supplementary s1 data) comparable to the increase caused by an equitoxic dose of hydrogen peroxide (13).;     in striking contrast 70% of potassium bromate-induced mutations are g to t changes (figure 1b supplementary table s1 supplementary s1 data) suggesting different mechanisms of mutagenesis induced by potassium bromate compared to hydrogen peroxide and pq 5062 nucleic acids research 2023 vol 51 no 10 in dna polymerase zeta-deficient (rev3) (figure 1a) eta-deficient (rad30) (supplementary figure s1a) and double mutant (rev3 rad30) (supplementary figure s1b) strains the frequencies of mutation induced by potassium bromate are significantly higher than the frequency of spontaneous mutations and do not differ from the frequencies of potassium bromate-induced mutations in the wild type strain.;     indeed we found that several tumor types contained samples with statistically significant enrichment with gca (tgc) -> tca (tga) motifs figure 1d supplementary figure s1c s1 data; shown in parentheses and in all cancer analyses outputs are reverse complements with a mutation of a pyrimidine base of the base pair).;     the signal was distinct from a background spectrum originating from the degradation product of dmpo (figure 2a supplementary figure s2b and s2c marked with o s2 data).;     the signal intensity however was unaffected by a large excess of dmso (figure 2e supplementary s2 data) a known quencher of hydroxyl radical indicating that the epr signal is not due to the trapping of hydroxyl radical.;     the signal intensity of the dmpo adduct was also unaffected by the presence of superoxide dismutase (sod) (figure 2d supplementary s2 data) suggesting that the signal is not the result of dmpo trapping of superoxide radical followed by conversion of dmposuperoxide adduct to the dmpo-hydroxyl radical adduct.;     red arrows are above peaks that represent the reactive species adduct with dmpo same reactions but employing a different spin trap pobn resulted in detection of esr spectra (simulation parameters an = 14 98 +/- 0 03 g and ah = 1 65 +/- 0 03 g) which are characteristic of the hydroxyl radical adduct of pobn (figure s2a supplementary s2 data) (6061) and just like in experiments with dmpo the signal intensity was unaffected by the presence of typical hydroxyl and superoxide radical quenchers (supplementary figure s2a panels d and e).;     although parameters an = 14 9 g and ah = 15 4 g reported in (62) are close to those derived from the spectra detected in this work (supplementary figure s2c s2 data) a number of publications have reported dmpo adducts of glutathiyl radical with magnetic parameters at or close to an = 15 4 g and ah = 16 2 g (63-66).;     principal component analysis (pca) revealed that the metabolic profiles of the strains exposed to mildly toxic doses of potassium bromate and hydrogen peroxide were significantly different from the profiles of unexposed cells and from each other (figure 3a supplementary data s3).;     similarly endogenous redox stress in strains lacking superoxide dismutase (sod1) and catalase (cta1) manifested itself in minor metabolic changes primarily in the sod1 compared to wild type strains (figure 3b supplementary figure s3a data s3).;     the amplitude of increase was comparable only to the positive control i e in the sod1 strains (figure 4b right panel s4 data) following exposure to pq.;     moreover potassium bromate induced higher levels of fluorescence compared to an equitoxic dose of pq in wild type cells (figure 4b left panel s4 data) whereas exposure to hydrogen peroxide (which we utilized as a negative control) did not produce any more fluorescence compared to unexposed wild type cells (figure 4c supplementary s4 data).;     after a 90-minute incubation period there was only a very small change in maximum signal intensity (supplementary figure s4b s4 data); this contrasts with nucleic acids research 2023 vol 51 no 10 5065 figure 3.;     in striking contrast to that report we found that the presence of wild-type sod1 dramatically increased the mutagenic potential of potassium bromate (figure 5a data s5).;     the endogenous antioxidant enzyme catalase 1 cta1 does not modulate the mutagenic potential of potassium bromate (supplementary figure s5a data s5) despite the fact that it is protective against hydrogen peroxide-induced mutagenesis (11).;     we did not observe a more pronounced augmentation of potassium bromate-induced cell killing by nac when we conducted the mutation frequency experiments (data s5) likely due to the fact that the cells were never exposed to the mixture of potassium bromate and antioxidants.;     to test whether the mixture of potassium bromate and thiolcontaining antioxidants is toxic for yeast cells we determined cell survival following exposure to solutions of different concentrations of nac in 100 mm potassium bromate (figure 6 data s6).",""

    gene set enrichment analysis (gsea) revealed that bhd-associated renal tumours exhibited increased oxidative phosphorylation and glutathione metabolism relative to sporadic chrccs whereas sporadic chrccs showed upregulated pathways related to various types of cancers cell cycle and dna replication when compared to bhd tumours consistent with the notion that bhd-associated renal tumours might be indolent with increased mitochondrial metabolism compared to sporadic chrccs (fig 1c) (supplementary dataset 2) 53031 importantly sporadic chrccs and sporadic oncocytomas were further clustered into two distinct clusters and differentially expressed genes (degs) analysis identified l1cam foxi1 and its downstream gene atp6v0d2 as molecular markers for these distinct clusters (group1 and 2) (figs1b 2a and 2b) 6 (supplementary dataset 3).;

    wgs analysis in this study together with our previous wes analysis confirmed somatic second hit flcn alterations in all of the bhd-associated renal tumours (fig 3a) (supplementary dataset 4) 16 in addition wgs analysis of bhd-associated renal tumours demonstrated that very few genes were commonly mutated except for flcn as was observed in our previous wes study suggesting that flcn alteration should be the main driver for bhd-associated renal tumourigenesis16 in f107 case interestingly amplification of vegfa and ccnd3 on chromosome 6 was observed which may lead to the formation of clear cell renal cell carcinoma f133-t1 whose histology was unclassified renal cell carcinoma harboured a variant in succinate dehydrogenase d (sdhd) a gene responsible for sdh-associated tumour predisposition syndrome 3233 the average number of mutations per tumour was1107 1090 and 1650 in bhd-associated chrccs bhdassociated hocts and sporadic chrccs in the tcga cohort (kich) respectively supporting that bhdassociated renal tumours have less inter-tumour heterogeneity than sporadic chrccs (fig 3b and supplementary dataset 5).;     bhd-associated renal tumours harbour mtdna with higher copy numbers and fewer variants a notable proportion (22 2%) of sporadic chrccs harbor non-silent mtdna variants without any variants in nuclear-encoded kidney cancer-associated genes whereas bhd-associated renal tumours harbor no disruptive alterations in mtdna suggesting that nonsilent mtdna variants in sporadic chrccs may be drivers of tumourigenesis of sporadic chrccs whereas mitochondrial function is most likely retained in bhd-associated renal tumours122935 consistent with these results heteroplasmic level or variant allele frequencies (vafs) of total and pathogenic variants in mtdna of bhd-associated renal tumours were significantly lower than those of sporadic chrccs (p = 0 0368 and 0 0117 respectively) (fig 4a) (supplementary dataset 6) mtdna copy numbers were higher in bhd-associated renal tumours compared to sporadic chrccs and variable depending on each histology (fig 4b and c) (supplementary fig s4) 10 bhd-associated renal tumours and sporadic chrcc may arise from different normal nephron cells a recent machine learning algorithm integrating bulk or single cell-level atac-seq (assay for transposaseaccessible chromatin using sequencing) data of normal cell types with somatic point mutation frequency derived from the wgs data of tumours enables us to predict putative cancer cell-of-origin (coo) based on a hypothesis that the somatic variants might preferentially accumulate outside of the open chromatin regions of the cancer cell of origin 36 in this study we applied the cooboostr algorithm to predict a putative cancer coo of bhd-associated renal tumours and sporadic chrccs26 interestingly the cooboostr predicted that bhd-associated renal tumours and sporadic chrccs may arise from a variety of normal nephron cells.;     the most frequently predicted cell-of-origin was proximal tubules for bhd-associated renal tumours and intercalated cells for sporadic chrccs implying the possibility that these two tumour types might arise from different cells of origin (fig 5a) (supplementary dataset 7).   data sharing statement all of sequencing data were deposited in national bioscience database center (nbdc) under the accession number jgas000564","for the series of analyses from fastq file data to gene expression level normalization the riboduct pipeline was used (https://github com/msfuji/riboduct) and the details of the commands and parameter settings are available in the github page."

    therefore in addition to gene-level fold changes provided in dataset s1 we took two approaches to examine distributions of expression change in each scd group contrast.;     ratio plots also highlight the prominence of direct dosage effects with ycd changes as compared to the greater degree of dosage compensation with xcd changes [notwithstanding the substantial direct dosage effects of xcd in both ratio plots (si appendix fig s2) and deg analysis (dataset s1)].;     distribution of differentially expressed genes (degs) across pairwise sex chromosome dosage (scd) group contrasts in lymphoblastoid cell lines (lcls) (a) bar chart showing the total number of degs in each group contrast (false-discovery rate q < 0 05; full deg list dataset s1) (b) stacked bar chart showing the proportion of degs in each contrast by chromosome of origin: autosomal par x and y (x- and y-specific nonpar) (c) upset plot showing which scd group contrasts capture each of the 3 main modes of scd variation: changes in x chromosome dosage (x) y chromosome dosage (y) and total scd (tscd).;     the combined set of 33 sex-linked ods genes showed statistically significant gene ontology (go) term enrichment for histone and protein demethylation-reflecting the prominent involvement of several gametolog gene pairs in these processes (e g kdm5c-kdm5d and kdm6a-uty corrected p < 0 005 datasets s4 and s5).;     genes with ods to xcd showed go term enrichment for translational initiation and regulation of translation (capturing known functions of eif1ax and rps4x dataset s4).;     genes pnas2023 vol 120 no 21 e2218478120 with ods to changes in xcd ycd and tscd in our full dataset were also recovered in control analyses using sample-size matched scd groups (si appendix fig s1c and dataset s6).;     to characterize non-ods gene expression changes in each scd group contrast we applied biological process go enrichment analyses to significant degs in each of the 15 contrasts (dataset s1) after excluding ods genes.;     six of all 15 scd group contrasts yielded statistically significant go term enrichments for non-ods genes (dataset s7) with a notable recurrence across the contrasts of go terms relating to oxidative stress.;     finally to complement contrast-level deg analyses we also examined scd effects in lcls through unsupervised clustering of sex chromosome genes by their mean expression profiles across scd groups (fig 3 dataset s8 and si appendix text s1 5).;     scd sensitivity (fig 3 datasets s8 and s9 and si appendix text s1 5).;     further replicating our prior results (13) we also found that the most scd-sensitive clusters of sex-linked genes in our current analyses were enriched for gametolog genes [xcie-cluster (k3 fig 3): odds ratio (or)=57 p = 5 3e-10 y-cluster (k7 fig 3): or = 1237 p < 2 2e-16 dataset s8 and si appendix text s1 5].;     go enrichment analysis of all clusters identified statistically significant go terms associated with maintenance of protein location and demethylation in the y-linked clusters (k2 and k4 respectively) as well as translational initiation and demethylation in the xcie cluster (k3) (dataset s10).;     to probe cross-cell type effects we applied the same analytic pipeline used in lcls to estimate scd effects on gene expression in fibroblasts (fcls) and ipsc-derived neuronal cells (ins) (degs for these two cell types with log2fc values listed in datasets s11 and s12).;     the detailed protocol for reprogramming of ipscs from skin biopsy fibroblasts and differentiation of ipscs to ins is described in si appendix texts s2 1 and s2 2 as are the procedures for characterization of ipscs and verification of excitatory neuronal status of ins (si appendix text s2 3 and fig s6 and dataset s13).;     third we identified degs for each individual scd group contrast in fcls (dataset s11) and ins (dataset s12) and-for each pnas2023 vol 120 no 21 e2218478120 contrast in each cell type-we tested if the observed deg set showed statistically significant overlap with degs (dataset s1) for the corresponding contrast in lcls (methods and materials si appendix text s3 1 fig 4 a-d lower).;     we provide complete lists of overlapping degs between each pair of cell types per scd group contrast in datasets s14 (lcls and fcls) and s15 (lcls and ins) across all three cell types in dataset s16.;     to achieve a more direct test of this hypothesis akin to that achieved in sex chromosome aneuploidy we filtered the meta-analytic dataset to retain 9 studies that included human cell lines (lcls fcls or ins) with trisomy 21 for comparison with control groups (dataset s17).;     the human ipsc lines used for this study (dataset s13) were derived from participant skin biopsy fibroblasts using cytotune(r) (life technologies) and underwent quality control including confirmation of genomic stability through snp array karyotyping and facs based pluripotency marker expression (42) (si appendix text s2 1) ipsc lines were differentiated to cortical neurons using the rapid single-step induction protocol published by zhang et al (43) (si appendix text s2 2).;     we identified significantly (fdr < 0 05) degs in each of 15 pairwise independent scd group contrasts separately in the three cell types (datasets s1 s11 and s12).;     in the core lcl dataset we identified 1476 genes (dataset s1 and fig 2) that showed significantly differential expression in at least one of all 15 pairwise contrasts.;     sensitivity analyses in a reduced and fully balanced https://doi org/10 1073/pnas2218478120 9 of 11 (i e sample-size matched) lcl dataset (n = 23 for each of the 6 scd groups following random removal of samples) demonstrated that the distribution of numbers of significant degs across15 contrasts was not driven by sample size variation across scd groups (si appendix text s1 2 and fig s1 and datasets s2 s3 and s6).;     go enrichment analysis was applied in these ods genes using enrichgo function of clusterprofiler (52) with the default background of all genes in the database (datasets s4 and s5).;     identical go enrichment analyses were also run for the non-ods degs (dataset s1) in each scd group contrast (dataset s7).;     second to match analytical methods in trisomy 21 to those applied to study scd effects we filtered the 67 studies in toma et al to retain only those including human lcl (n = 3) fcl (n=4) in (n=2) (dataset s17) and we downloaded the list of degs in each of these selected studies (degs defined by toma et al as those with adjusted p < 0 05 and absolute fold change >1 5 https://github com/ilarius/ds_meta_analysis).",""

    to create an appropriate matrix of information by which to understand broad binding we chose a subset of antibodies for structural analysis including two triple-specific antibodies skt05 and skt20 and supplemented these with single-specific antibodies each from a different competition group and against a different target vlp (figures4a-4d table s3 and data s1).;     with veev we determined complex structures with the triplespecific mab skt20 as well as the veev-neutralizing single-specific mabs skv09 and skv16 skt20 recognized the conserved fusion peptide in domain ii of the e1 protein (figure 4a table s3 and data s1) skv09 bound e1 at the vlp pseudo-six-fold axis with a restricted stoichiometry of only 0 375 fabs per trimer (figure 4b table s3 and data s1).;     by contrast skv16 and skt20 both recognized the e1e2 trimer with stoichiometries of 3 fabs per trimer; skv16 bound specifically to domain b of e2 (figure 4b table s3 and data s1).;     with eeev we determined the cryo-em structure at 3 5 a resolution for the antigen-binding fragment of the eeev-neutralizing mab ske26 which bound primarily to the a domain of the e2 protein (figure 4c table s3 and data s1).;     with weev we determined complex structure with weevneutralizing single-specific mabs skw11 skw19 and skw24 as well as the triple-specific mab skt05 skt05 (figure 4a table s3 and data s1) showed almost lateral recognition binding domain ii of the e1 protein proximal to the fusion peptide.;     we developed a refinement algorithm selecting and grouping only the appropriate fab-bound e1e2 protomers in the reconstruction density which improved resolution from 5 7 to 4 2 a all three single-specific mabs bound the e2 protein skw11 primarily bound the b-ribbon of the e2 protein with a 45-degree approach angle (figure 4d table s3 and data s1).;     both skw19 and skw24 primarily bound the b domain of the e2 protein with skw19 (figure 4d table s3 and data s1) binding at a more equatorial approach angle compared to skw24 (figure 4d table s3 and data s1) which was lateral in its binding angle.;     see also figures s4 and s5 and data s1.;     for this analysis we included not only the weev-skt05 structure at 4 2 a resolution (figure 4a and table s3) but also added the structure of veev-skt05 at 3 5 a resolution (table s3 and data s1).;     see also table s3 and data s1.;     see also data s1 substantiated by a docked structure of skt05 fab in complex with chikv vlp which revealed compatible binding to those regions identified for weev and veev (figure 7b).;

    we carried out whole-genome sequencing on these isolates as well as additional isolates and populations from earlier passages of the evolution (supplementary dataset 2).;     despite the numerous canonical target mutations several resistant isolates as well as populations from intermediate passages of most of the ten independent populations did not carry any canonical mutations in genes coding for either the dna gyrase or topoisomerase iv enzymes or had mutations in only one of the targets (fig 1 and supplementary dataset 2).;     contrary to typical efflux pump mutations that occur in the promoter region (or in a repressor) we observed that eight out of the ten evolved populations contained one of two sdrm coding sequence mutations y363h (sdrm1*) or a268s (sdrm2*) but none of the evolved isolates had both (fig 1 supplementary dataset 2) raising the possibility that these two mutations might have similar functionality.;     in addition to the sdrm alleles coverage analysis of the wholegenome sequencing results revealed that the coverage of the sdrm gene was2-5-fold higher than the mean coverage of the genome in multiple evolved mutants compared to ~1x coverage in the wt indicating an amplification of the sdrm gene across all ten evolved populations (fig 1 supplementary dataset 2) (fig 2a).;     source data for b-f are provided in the source data file further seven strains with an a268v mutation (supplementary dataset 3).;     while five of these amplifications had microhomology of 4-12 base pairs between the two terminals the others had either a single base pair homology or no homology (supplementary dataset 4).;     efflux pump gene amplifications play a role in dlx resistance in addition to the point mutations in sdrm we identified 13 distinct types of amplifications from our whole-genome sequencing data across our ten evolved populations that amplified the sdrm gene (figs1 and 3a supplementary dataset 4 supplementary fig 5).;     all three isolates were predicted to have efflux pump amplifications where 1 7a had amplification type 9 and both 4 2a and 6c had amplification type 1 (fig 3b supplementary dataset 4).;     additionally 1 7a and 6c had mutations in a few other non-canonical genes but these mutations did not affect resistance to dlx (supplementary dataset 2 supplementary fig 8).;     each wt population had a novel amplification type not seen in the original evolution (supplementary dataset 4).;     we therefore tested the population heterogeneity for antibiotic resistance in the evolved isolates1 7a and 6c that have genomic amplifications but no canonical target mutations as well as an isolate from the final passage of an evolved sdrm::tn population that has mutations in gyra gyrb and pare (fig 5b supplementary dataset 2).;

    histology of kidney sections indicated increased thickness of the renal cortex and increased coronal length of the kidney (fig 1d and supplementary fig 1c for definitions of length and supplementary data 2 for individual data).;     in contrast in cortical collecting ducts there was a significant increase in both outer diameter and cell count per unit length (fig 1g see supplementary data 3 for individual data).;     a list of hypotheses about signals resulting from nephrectomy that could be transduced to trigger these changes is provided in fig 2 supplementary data 4 and the supplementary discussion 1.;     supplementary table 1 shows the most abundant transcription factors in the s1 segment with reference to our hypotheses about signal transduction in compensatory hypertrophy (from fig 2 and supplementary data 4).;     sham (see supplementary data 5 for full results of motif enrichment).;     importantly the hnf4/ ppar binding motif exhibited sharply elevated enrichment in the differentially accessible peak set compared to the total peak set (47% vs28%) while no enrichment is found for the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 beta (hnf1) motif (fig 3c supplementary data 5) indicating that the hnf4/ppar motif is abundant in proximal tubules at baseline and this motif is further enriched in unx vs.;     motif analysis of peaks that exhibited decreased accessibility revealed only one significant match to known transcription factor motifs namely hnf1 (supplementary fig 2d supplementary data 5 for full motif analysis data).;     full atac-seq data can be viewed in supplementary data 6 or at https://esbl nhlbi nih gov/igv_mo/.;     curated target genes for each transcription factor are summarized in supplementary data 7.;     at 24 h the largest changes of the average of log2 (unx/sham) for all identified regions can be seen for nr1h4 ppar and hnf4 target genes (supplementary fig 2f) (see supplementary data 8 for statistics).;     figure 4a summarizes the rna-seq data for s1 proximal tubules24 h after surgery (see also supplementary fig 3a supplementary data 9) 215 transcripts were significantly increased (padj < 0 05 and log2[unx/sham] > 0 50) and 95 transcripts were significantly decreased (padj < 0 05 and log2[unx/sham] < -0 50) in 3 article https://doi org/10 1038/s41467-023-38958-9 fig 1 | compensatory hypertrophy after unilateral nephrectomy (unx) occurs rapidly and is largely because of increased cell volume in proximal tubule a sample collection protocol.;     also highly enriched were \"mtorc1 signaling\" \"oxidative phosphorylation\" and \"cholesterol homeostasis\" which are all relevant to the hypothesized mechanisms (supplementary data 4).;     large increases can be seen for ppar and hnf4 target genes and small decreases were seen for stat6 smad4 crem and nr1h4 target genes (supplementary data 8).;     ingenuity (ipa) upstream regulator analysis of regulated transcripts (fig 4d supplementary fig 3c) showed that the top 3 transcription factors predicted to be activated are ppar srebf1 and hnf4 and kinases predicted to be activated are serine/threonine kinase 11 (stk11 also called lkb1) and insulin receptor (insr) (full analysis in supplementary data 10).;     in contrast to the proximal tubule the data show increases in a large number of genes associated with cell proliferation including e2f target transcripts (padj < 0 05 and log2 unx/sham > 0 50 highlighted in red) (see also supplementary fig 4a supplementary data 11).;     the general picture at 72 h was the same as that seen at 24 h (fig 5c supplementary fig 4c d supplementary table 3; see supplementary data 12 for full data).;     figure 6a shows a volcano plot summarizing the data (see supplementary data 13 for full data).;     upregulated genes associated with \"g2m checkpoint\" and \"e2f targets\" in gsea substantially overlapped with those seen in ccd at the 24 h timepoint pointing to a tendency toward a hyperplasia profile despite the lack of morphological evidence for frank proximal tubule hyperplasia (fig 6d supplementary data 14 supplementary fig 1d).;     however similar to the 24-h time point ipa upstream analysis for transcription factors suggested activation of srebf1 ppar and hnf4 (fig 6f supplementary data 15).;     these hypotheses summarize signaling pathways known to mediate responses to mechanical or metabolic signals likely to be triggered by loss of one kidney (see also supplementary discussion 1 nature communications | (2023)14:3481 https://doi org/10 1038/s41467-023-38958-9 and supplementary data 4).;

    unx/sham > 0 20 or < -0 20) (see also supplementary data 16).;     ipa upstream analysis for transcription factors at 24 h showed that ppar was among the top 3 predicted transcription factors in the regulation of protein expression while hnf4 was not (fig 7e supplementary data 17 for full analysis).;     based on ipa upstream analysis for kinases at 24 h ampk (prkaa 1 2) was predicted to be inhibited while akt1 was predicted to be activated at 24 h (supplementary data 17).;     of the 5778 proteins quantified 208 were increased and 352 were decreased (fig 7f) based on dual criteria (dashed lines p < 0 1 and log2 unx/sham > 0 20 or <-0 20) (see also supplementary data 18).;     ipa upstream analysis for transcription factors using kidney cortex samples showed ppar as the top predicted transcription factor in the regulation of protein expression which was consistent with the result from the whole kidney (fig 7g supplementary data 19).;     ipa upstream analysis for kinases showed in contradiction to that from whole kidney analysis ampk (prkaa 1 2) as activated and mtor as inhibited (supplementary fig 6g supplementary data 19) \"mtorc1 signaling\" show that upregulation of these target proteins found at 24 h become less evident at 72 h consistent with the results from trajectory analysis using rna seq datasets.;     ipa upstream analysis for transcription factors predicted that both ppar and hnf4 were activated (fig 8e-left) and ipa analysis for kinases suggested that ampk (prkaa 1 2) may be activated (fig 8e-right) at 72 h (supplementary data 21).;     proteomic response to unilateral nephrectomy at 72 h 72-hour proteomics (fig 8a) showed that of the 5855 proteins quantified 165 were increased and 594 were decreased based on the same criteria as used for the 24-hour data (full data in supplementary data 20) volcano plots (fig 8b) and bubble plots (fig 8c) for ppar target proteins gsea targets for \"fatty acid metabolism\" and nature communications | (2023)14:3481 phosphoproteomic response to unilateral nephrectomy quantitative phosphoproteomics analysis was carried out for whole kidneys after unx or sham surgery at two time points namely 24 and 72 h (see https://esbl nhlbi nih gov/databases/unx-phospho/ and supplementary data 22 and 23 for full data).;     specifically phosphorylation of prkab1 (ampk beta-1 regulatory subunit) at s108 is known to induce ampk activity27 and phosphorylation at this site was decreased at the 72 h time point (log2 (unx/sham) = -0 67 supplementary data 24).;     multi-omics data integration we integrated results from nine -omics data sets presented in this study (fig 9a) using the database for annotation visualization and integrated discovery (david) (https://david ncifcrf gov/home jsp) to identify biological processes most likely to regulate renal hypertrophy in proximal tubules (see supplementary data 25).;

    in addition the quantitative analysis of lipid content in mouse kidney (fig 9d and e supplementary data 27) revealed that the concentration of triglycerides and phospholipid in the kidney from unx group were increased by ~2-fold and 80 8% respectively compared with sham group which is consistent with the increased levels of overall fatty acid concentrations in unx group.;     cortical thickness was also significantly increased (figs10c and 10d supplementary data 28).;     confocal fluorescence images of proximal tubules (fig 10e) microdissected from vehicle-treated mice (left) versus fenofibrate-treated mice (right) showed significant increases in outer diameter and mean cell volume in response to fenofibrate (see also supplementary data 29).;     a cellular size increase was also seen in liver suggesting hypertrophy caused by fenofibrates is systemic rather than specific for the kidney (supplementary fig 7d supplementary data 30).;     confocal images of microdissected proximal tubules showed a clear decrease in the cellular volume and tubular outer diameter and an increase in the cell count per unit length in ppar-null mice (fig 10j supplementary fig 7i supplementary data 31) showing that ppar is an important determinant of proximal tubule cell size.;

    a chow test indicated the absence of strong differences between participants with a history of any cardiovascular disease or use of rhr-altering medication versus participants without such a medical history (supplementary data 4).;     genetic correlation analyses were performed and we observed significant correlations with anthropometric measurements pulse wave reflection index and physical activity measurements (supplementary data 5).;     a query of the gwas catalog showed that the 493 genetic variants associated with rhr were most commonly in high ld (ld > 0 8) with anthropometric measurements and blood pressure traits (supplementary data 6).;     candidate genes and insights into biology we explored the potential biology of the 352 rhr-associated loci by prioritizing candidate genes in these loci (supplementary data 2).;     a total of 407 unique genes were in close proximity to the lead variant defined as the nearest gene and any additional gene within 10 kb (supplementary data 2).;

    systematic alteration of key differences between the current and previous mendelian randomization study indicated that the most likely cause of the discrepancy between these studies arises from false positive findings in single-nucleus rna expression single-nucleus rna sequencing data obtained from a healthy human heart revealed that rhr gene expression is highest in ventricular cardiomyocytes followed by atrial cardiomyocytes (supplementary data 14)15.;

    the direct effects of genetically predicted rhr on any stroke and ischemic stroke were most strongly attenuated by pulse pressure with estimated attenuation of 28 1% and 31 5% respectively (fig 6a b supplementary data 27 28).;     there was a strong association between genetically predicted rhr and pulse pressure ( = -0 192 se = 0 019 p = 1 81 x 10-24) but mrsteiger sensitivity analysis filtered a large part of the genetic variants and repeating the mr on the remaining subset did not show a significant association between rhr and pulse pressure ( = -0 005 se = 0 008 p = 0 57 supplementary data 29 30).;
